'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] which considers the [[state (polity)|state]] undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful, and instead promotes a [[stateless society]], or [[anarchy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;

==Etymology and terminology==
{{Related articles|Anarchist terminology}}
The term ''[[wikt:anarchism|anarchism]]'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἄναρχος, ''anarchos'', meaning &quot;without rulers&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anarchy Anarchy]. [[Merriam-Webster]] online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]], &amp; [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott, Robert]], &quot;[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]&quot;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%237439].&lt;/ref&gt; from the prefix ἀν- (''an-'', &quot;without&quot;) + ἀρχή (''archê'', &quot;sovereignty, realm, magistracy&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Liddell |first=Henry George |coauthors=Scott, Robert |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2315894|isbn=0-19-910205-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; + -ισμός (''-ismos'', from the [[Suffix (linguistics)|suffix]] -ιζειν, ''-izein'' &quot;-izing&quot;). There is some ambiguity with the use of the terms &quot;[[libertarianism]]&quot; and &quot;libertarian&quot; in writings about anarchism. Since the 1890s from France,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau |first=Max |authorlink=Max Nettlau |year=1996 |publisher=Freedom Press |isbn=0-900384-89-1 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term &quot;libertarianism&quot; has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Dean. [http://www.boogieonline.com/revolution/politics/name.html ''Who is a Libertarian?''], [[Foundation for Economic Education]], &quot;Ideas on Liberty,&quot; May, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{Main|History of anarchism}}
[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|left|thumb|[[William Godwin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot; /&gt;]]
Anarchist themes can be found in the works of [[Taoism|Taoist]] sages [[Laozi]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html &quot;Anarchism&quot;], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhuangzi]] and Bao Jingyan [http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-one-from-anarchy-to-anarchism-300ce-1939/]. Zhuangzi wrote, ''&quot;A petty thief is put in jail. A great brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation,&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/9_2/9_2_3.pdf|format=PDF|title=Concepts of the role of intellectuals in social change toward laissez faire|author=[[Murray Rothbard]]|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Bao Jingyan said that as soon as &quot;the relationship between lord and subject is established, hearts become daily filled with evil designs, until the manacled criminals sullenly doing forced labour in the mud and the dust are full of mutinous thoughts.&quot; [[Diogenes of Sinope]] and the [[Cynic]]s, their contemporary [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]], also introduced similar topics.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{iep|c/cynics.htm|Cynics|Julie Piering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;anarchist&quot; first entered the English language in 1642, during the [[English Civil War]], as a [[Pejorative|term of abuse]], used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] against their [[Roundhead]] opponents.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; By the time of the [[French Revolution]] some, such as the ''[[Enragés]]'', began to use the term positively,&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. ''Anarchism'', London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; in opposition to [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] centralisation of power, seeing &quot;revolutionary government&quot; as [[oxymoron]]ic.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; By the turn of the 19th century, the English word &quot;anarchism&quot; had lost its initial negative connotation.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;&quot;Anarchism&quot;, ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'' 2006 (UK version).&lt;/ref&gt; From this climate [[William Godwin]] developed what many consider the first expression of [[anarchist schools of thought|modern anarchist thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt; Godwin was, according to [[Peter Kropotkin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot; /&gt; while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to [[Edmund Burke]]'s '' [[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. &quot;Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence...&quot; – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Tucker]] instead credits [[Josiah Warren]], an American who promoted stateless and [[voluntary community|voluntary communities]] where all goods and services were [[privatization|private]], with being &quot;the first man to expound and formulate the doctrine now known as Anarchism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Liberty'' XIV (December, 1900:1).&lt;/ref&gt; The first to describe himself as an anarchist was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]],&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml &quot;Anarchism&quot;], [[BBC Radio 4]] program, [[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]], Thursday 7 December 2006. Hosted by [[Melvyn Bragg]] of the BBC, with John Keane, Professor of Politics at [[University of Westminster]], [[Ruth Kinna]], Senior Lecturer in Politics at [[Loughborough University]], and [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]], philosopher and historian.&lt;/ref&gt; a French philosopher and politician, which led some to call him the founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social movement==
Anarchism as a [[social movement]] has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. Its classical period, which scholars demarcate as from 1860 to 1939, is associated with the working-class movements of the 19th century and the [[Spanish Civil War]]-era struggles against [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen, &quot;Introduction: Why Anarchism Still Matters&quot;, in Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen (eds), ''Changing Anarchism: Anarchist Theory and Practice in a Global Age'' (Manchester: [[Manchester University Press]], 2004), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The First International===
{{Main|International Workingmen's Association}}
[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|Collectivist anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] opposed the [[Marxist]] aim of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in favour of universal rebellion, and allied himself with the federalists in the First International before his expulsion by the Marxists.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;]]

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Breunig |first=Charles |title=The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789–1850 |year=1977 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |location=New York, N.Y |isbn=0-393-09143-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (sometimes called the &quot;First International&quot;) united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Blin | first = Arnaud | title = The History of Terrorism | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-520-24709-4 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blanquism|Blanquists]], [[Philadelphes]], English trade unionists, [[socialists]] and [[social democrats]].

Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization. [[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx's [[state socialism]], advocating political [[abstentionism]] and small property holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dodson | first = Edward | title = The Discovery of First Principles: Volume 2 | publisher = Authorhouse | page=312 | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-595-24912-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |ref=harv | location = London | year = 1985 | isbn = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] (LPF), Russian revolutionary [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his [[collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchist]] associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Thomas | first = Paul | title = Karl Marx and the Anarchists | publisher = Routledge and Kegan Paul | location = London | year = 1980 | isbn = 0-7102-0685-2 |page=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allied themselves with the [[federalist]] socialist sections of the International,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bak | first = Jǹos | title = Liberty and Socialism | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-8476-7680-3 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.

At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Engel | first = Barbara | title = Mothers and Daughters | publisher = Northwestern University Press | location = Evanston | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-8101-1740-1 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[centralism|centralist]] and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|origyear=1873|year=1991|title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-36973-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.&lt;ref name=Graham-05&gt;Graham, Robert '[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm ''Anarchism''] (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1-55164-251-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organised labour===
{{Main|Anarcho-syndicalism|International Workers' Association|Anarchism in Spain|Spanish Revolution}}
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organization of labor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas'', Vol. 1, p. 100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] would become standard.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt;

In response, unions across the [[United States]] prepared a [[general strike]] in support of the event.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt; On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when [[strikebreaker]]s attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Avrich |first=Paul |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |year=1984 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0-691-00600-8 |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |page=193 |isbn=0-691-04711-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3972-patrolman-mathias-j.-degan |title=Patrolman Mathias J.

The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight hour day was made.The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Foner |title=May Day |page=42 |isbn=0-7178-0624-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of [[International Workers' Day]] on [[May Day]] had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.&lt;ref name=foner&gt;{{Cite book| last = Foner | first = Philip Sheldon | title = May day: a short history of the international workers' holiday, 1886–1986 | publisher = International Publishers | location = New York | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-7178-0624-3 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:ChicagoAnarchists.jpg|thumb|A sympathetic engraving by [[Walter Crane]] of the executed &quot;Anarchists of Chicago&quot; after the [[Haymarket affair]]. The Haymarket affair is generally considered the most significant event for the origin of international [[May Day]] observances]]
In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], and [[Christiaan Cornelissen]]. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a [[social revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the trade-union movement was [[reformism|reformist]] and even [[Conservatism|conservative]], citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Skirda | first = Alexandre | title = [[Facing the Enemy|Facing the enemy: a history of anarchist organization from Proudhon to May 1968]] | publisher = [[A.

The [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNT was affiliated with the [[International Workers Association]], a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular &quot;The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Anarchism in Brazil|Brazil]], Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was
undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organizations was the [[Federación Obrera Regional Argentina]]...it grew quickly
to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt;

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993–2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]]. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]], claiming 2,000 paying members, and the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.

===Propaganda of the deed and illegalism===
{{Main|Propaganda of the deed|Illegalism|Expropriative anarchism}}
[[Image:Lugi Gallean2.jpg|180px|left|thumb|[[Italian-American]] anarchist [[Luigi Galleani]]. His followers, known as Galleanists, carried out a series of bombings and assassination attempts from 1914 to 1932 in what they saw as attacks on 'tyrants' and 'enemies of the people']]
Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html |title=&quot;Action as Propaganda&quot; by Johann Most, July 25, 1885 |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date=2003-04-21 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, the slogan &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; had begun to be used both within and outside of the anarchist movement to refer to individual bombings, [[regicide]]s and [[tyrannicide]]s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal ‘[[Confiscation|expropriations]]’.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zabalaza.net/theory/txt_anok_comm_ap.htm &quot;Anarchist-Communism&quot; by Alain Pengam]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illegalism]] as a practice emerged and within it &quot;The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (&quot;[[propaganda by the deed]]&quot;) and the anarchist burglars (&quot;[[individual reappropriation]]&quot;) expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be exemplary , invitations to revolt.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;illegalism&quot;&gt;[http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm &quot;The &quot;illegalists&quot; by Doug Imrie. From &quot;Anarchy: a Journal Of Desire Armed&quot; , Fall-Winter, 1994-95]&lt;/ref&gt; France's [[Bonnot Gang]] was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. [[Peter Kropotkin]] thus wrote that year in ''Le Révolté'' that &quot;a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Billington, James H. 1998. ''Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' New Jersey: Transaction Books, p 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the [[trade union]] movement. The [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Fernand Pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without &quot;the individual dynamiter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm |title=Table Of Contents |publisher=Blackrosebooks.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labor movement]]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]], favored individualist political expression and acts.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]'s '[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]' of 1793–1794. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organizing on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]'s imperialist expansion– in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.&quot; (in {{Cite news|author=Benedict Anderson |title=In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel |publisher=[[New Left Review]]|date=July -August 2004|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2519}}) &lt;/blockquote&gt; According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organization may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement. For example, U.S. [[William McKinley|President McKinley]]'s assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [[feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]]. This was in spite of Goldman's disavowal of any association with him, his registered membership in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and never having belonged to an anarchist organization. Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because [[international terrorism]] arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite. This image remains to this day.

Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after [[World War I]] (1914–1918) and the [[1917 October Revolution]].

===Russian Revolution===
{{Main|Anarchism in Russia|Russian Revolution (1917)}}
[[Image:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]
Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-520-07297-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]] which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = The Russian Anarchists | publisher = AK Press | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-904859-48-8 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, in the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Free Territory]], they fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against the [[White movement|Whites]] (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new &quot;socialist&quot; Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]&quot; in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Goldman | first = Emma | title = [[My Disillusionment in Russia]] |chapter=Preface |page=xx | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-486-43270-X |quote= My critic further charged me with believing that &quot;had the Russians made the Revolution à la Bakunin instead of à la Marx&quot; the result would have been different and more satisfactory. I plead guilty to the charge. In truth, I not only believe so; I am certain of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] left the organizations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| editor1-last = Drachkovitch | editor1-first = Milorad M. |first=Max |last=Nomad |contribution=The Anarchist Tradition title = Revolutionary Internationals 1864 1943 | publisher = Stanford University Press |page=88 | year = 1966 | isbn = 0-8047-0293-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the ''[[Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)]]'',&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dielo Trouda |authorlink=Dielo Truda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 |accessdate=2006-10-24 |year=2006 |publisher=FdCA |location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; was supported. [[Platformist]] groups active today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland and the [[NEFAC|North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] of North America.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 &quot;Daring but Divided&quot;] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The veteran Italian anarchist, Luigi Fabbri, was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as &quot;the preventive counter-revolution.&quot; [http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-one-from-anarchy-to-anarchism-300ce-1939/] In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David. &quot;Fascism or Revolution.&quot; ''Le Libertaire''. August 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The guarantees of the 1940 Constitution permitted them to legally create an organization of this type, and it was thus that they agreed to dissolve the two principal Cuban anarchist organizations, the SIA and FGAC, and create a new, unified group, the Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (ALC), a sizable organization with a membership in the thousands.&quot;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Frank_Fernandez__Cuban_Anarchism__The_History_of_A_Movement.html#toc8 ''Cuban Anarchism: The History of A Movement'' by Frank Fernandez]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerges as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but is repressed by the new Communist regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertgraham.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 in [[Anarchism in France|France]] the [[Fédération Anarchiste]] is established and the also [[Synthesist anarchism|synthesist]] [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana]] is founded in [[Anarchism in Italy|Italy]].

Anarchism continued to be influential in important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as [[Albert Camus]], [[Herbert Read]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Dwight Macdonald]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Julian Beck]] and the French [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] group led by [[André Breton]] which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the [[Fédération Anarchiste]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It was in the black mirror of anarchism that surrealism first recognised itself,&quot; wrote André Breton in &quot;The Black Mirror of Anarchism,&quot; Selection 23 in Robert Graham, ed., ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939-1977)''[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/].

[[Anarcho-pacifism]] became influential in the [[Anti-nuclear movement]] and [[anti war movement]]s of the time&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the forties and fifties, anarchism, in fact if not in name, began to reappear, often in alliance with pacifism, as the basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War.[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/] The anarchist/pacifist wing of the peace movement was small in comparison with the wing of the movement that emphasized electoral work, but made an important contribution to the movement as a whole. Where the more conventional wing of the peace movement rejected militarism and war under all but the most dire circumstances, the anarchist/pacifist wing rejected these on principle.&quot;[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm &quot;Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement&quot; by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the 1950s and 1960s anarcho-pacifism began to gel, tough-minded anarchists adding to the mixture their critique of the state, and tender-minded pacifists their critique of violence. Its first practical manifestation was at the level of method: nonviolent direct action, principled and pragmatic, was used widely in both the Civil Rights movement in the USA and the campaign against nuclear weapons in Britain and elsewhere.&quot;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Geoffrey_Ostergaard__Resisting_the_Nation_State._The_pacifist_and_anarchist_tradition.html#toc13 Geoffrey Ostergaard.

&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of [[anarcha-feminism]], they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. The [[American Civil Rights Movement]] and the movement against the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]] also contributed to the revival of North American anarchism. European anarchism of the late 20th century drew much of its strength from the labour movement, and both have incorporated [[animal rights]] activism. Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] and anarchist historian [[Andrej Grubacic]] have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those &quot;who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits&quot; of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are &quot;much more informed, among other elements, by [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous]], [[feminism|feminist]], [[ecology|ecological]] and [[counterculture|cultural-critical]] ideas&quot;, and who by the turn of the 21st century formed &quot;by far the majority&quot; of anarchists.&lt;ref name=&quot;graeber&quot;&gt;[[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]], &quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796 Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century]&quot;, [[ZNet]].

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and [[anti-globalisation movement]]s.&lt;ref name=rupert&gt;{{Cite book| page=66 |last = Rupert | first = Mark | title = Globalization and International Political Economy | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-7425-2943-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), [[G8|Group of Eight]], and the [[World Economic Forum]]. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police, and the confrontations were selectively portrayed in mainstream media coverage as violent riots. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as ''[[black bloc]]s''; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity groups]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; A landmark struggle of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt;

International anarchist federations in existence include the [[International of Anarchist Federations]], the [[International Workers' Association]], and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]].

==Anarchist schools of thought==
{{Main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|Portrait of philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) by [[Gustave Courbet]]. Proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and influenced many later [[individualist anarchist]] thinkers.]]
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, [[individualist anarchism]] and [[social anarchism]], which have some different origins, values and evolution.&lt;ref name=slevin/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;black dict&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/archive/Anarchism Anarchism], [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1855069954 The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt; The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises [[negative liberty]], i.e. opposition to state or [[social control]] over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise [[positive liberty]] to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, &quot;recognizing equality of entitlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Kevin and Boyd, Tony. ''Understanding Political Ideas and Movements''. Manchester University Press 2003, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In chronological and theoretical sense there are classical — those created throughout the 19th century — and post-classical anarchist schools — those created since the mid-20th century and after.

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is [[philosophical anarchism]], which embodies the theoretical stance that the [[state (polity)|state]] lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12).

(Mar., 1986), pp. 300-302.&lt;/ref&gt; philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a [[minarchism|minimal state]] as unfortunate, and usually temporary, &quot;necessary evil&quot; but argue that citizens do not have a [[moral obligation]] to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Klosko, George. ''Political Obligations''. Oxford University Press 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was &quot;[[anarchism without adjectives]]&quot;, a call for [[toleration]] first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the &quot;bitter debates&quot; of anarchist theory at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''[[Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America]]''. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist- and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the [[anti-authoritarian]] beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard &quot;Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898&quot; [p. 135].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutualism===
{{Main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism began in 18th century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A member of a community,&quot; ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticised [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge; [[Shawn Wilburn|Wilbur, Shawn]], 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 &quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon proposed [[spontaneous order]], whereby organization emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where order arises when everybody does &quot;what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=The Principle of Federation |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1979 |isbn=0-8020-5458-7 |quote=The notion of ''anarchy'' in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to William Batchelder Greene, each worker in the mutualist system would receive &quot;just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Communism versus Mutualism&quot;, ''Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments''. (Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875) [[William Batchelder Greene]]: &quot;Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', Princeton University Press 1996 ISBN 0-691-04494-5, p.6&lt;br /&gt;''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', Blackwell Publishing 1991 ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon first characterised his goal as a &quot;third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''What Is Property?'' Princeton, MA: Benjamin R. Tucker, 1876. p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individualist anarchism===
{{Main|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the [[anarchist]] movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryner&quot;&gt;&quot;What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.&quot;[http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker&quot;&gt;&quot;I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.&quot;&quot;Anarchism and the State&quot; in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

[[Image:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|[[19th century philosophy|19th century philosopher]] [[Max Stirner]], usually considered a prominent early [[individualist anarchist]] (sketch by [[Friedrich Engels]]).]]
In 1793, [[William Godwin]], who has often&lt;ref&gt;Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; been cited as the first anarchist, wrote ''[[Political Justice]]'', which some consider to be the first expression of anarchism.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a [[rationalist]] and [[utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present &quot;necessary evil&quot; that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|godwin|William Godwin|Mark Philip|2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J.

Godwin was a utilitarian who believed that all individuals are not of equal value, with some of us &quot;of more worth and importance&quot; than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good. Therefore he does not believe in equal rights, but the person's life that should be favoured that is most conducive to the general good.&lt;ref name=pmcl119/&gt; Godwin opposed government because he saw it as infringing on the individual's right to &quot;private judgement&quot; to determine which actions most maximise utility, but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual's judgement. This aspect of Godwin's philosophy, stripped of utilitarian motivations, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner.&lt;ref&gt;Paul McLaughlin.

===Social anarchism===
{{Main|Social anarchism}}
Social anarchism calls for a system with public ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without any government authority or [[coercion]]. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This does not mean that the majority thread within the anarchist movement is uncritical of individualist anarchism. Far from it! Social anarchists have argued that this influence of non-anarchist ideas means that while its &quot;criticism of the State is very searching, and [its] defence of the rights of the individual very powerful,&quot; like Spencer it &quot;opens . . . the way for reconstituting under the heading of 'defence' all the functions of the State.&quot; [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secGint.html Section G – Is individualist anarchism capitalistic?

This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or &quot;[[propaganda by the deed]]&quot;, which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot; /&gt;

However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by [[anarchist communists]] as effectively &quot;uphold[ing] the wages system&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |title=The Conquest of Bread |publisher=AK Press |location=Edinburgh |year=2007 |chapter=13 |isbn=978-1-904859-10-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]] but opposed the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bakunin |first=Mikhail |title=Statism and Anarchy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1990 |isbn=0-521-36182-6 |quote=They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship&amp;nbsp;– their dictatorship, of course&amp;nbsp;– can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not [[mutually exclusive]]; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|authorlink=James Guillaume|last=Guillaume |first=James |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm |title=Ideas on Social Organization |year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarchist communism]] proposes that the freest form of [[social organisation]] would be a society composed of [[self-governance|self-managing]] [[Commune (socialism)|communes]] with collective use of the [[means of production]], organised [[democracy|democratically]], and related to other communes through [[federation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LibCom&quot;&gt;[[Isaac Puente|Puente, Isaac]].[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libcom.html &quot;Libertarian Communism&quot;]. ''The Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review''. Issue 6 Orkney 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; While some anarchist communists favour [[direct democracy]], others feel that its [[majority rule|majoritarianism]] can impede individual liberty and favour [[consensus democracy]] instead. In anarchist communism, as money would be abolished, individuals would not receive direct [[Remuneration|compensation]] for labour (through sharing of [[Profit (economics)|profits]] or payment) but would have free access to the resources and surplus of the commune.&lt;ref&gt;Miller. ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', Blackwell Publishing (1991) ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Graeber|Graeber, David]] and Grubacic, Andrej. ''Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century''.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist communism does not always have a [[communitarian]] philosophy. Some forms of anarchist communism are [[egoist anarchism|egoist]] and strongly influenced by radical individualism,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Gray, ''Leaving the Twentieth Century'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; believing that anarchist communism does not require a communitarian nature at all.

In the early 20th century, [[anarcho-syndicalism]] arose as a distinct school of thought within anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David, ''A History of the French Anarchist Movement'', 1917–1945 p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; With greater focus on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism, [[syndicalism]] posits radical [[trade union]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society, democratically [[Workers' self-management|self-managed by the workers]]. It is often combined with other branches of anarchism, and anarcho-syndicalists often subscribe to [[anarchist communism|anarchist communist]] or [[collectivist anarchist]] [[economic system]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq-social&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Iain Mckay |title=[[An Anarchist FAQ]] |publisher=[[AK Press]] |location=Stirling |year=2008 |isbn=1-902593-90-1 |oclc=182529204|chapter=Are there different types of social anarchism? |url=http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA3.html#seca32}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early leading anarcho-syndicalist thinker was [[Rudolf Rocker]], whose 1938 pamphlet ''Anarchosyndicalism'' outlined a view of the movement's origin, aims and importance to the future of labour.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq-social&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spunk.org/library/writers/rocker/sp001495/rocker_as1.html ''Anarchosyndicalism]'' by [[Rudolf Rocker]].

Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and [[Syncretic politics|syncretic]], combining disparate and contrary concepts to create new philosophical approaches.

&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Perlin, Terry M. ''[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=mppLKlwHx7oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Contemporary+_+Anarchism&amp;ei=vSDBSuXHMo2mM8mu-OsP#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Contemporary Anarchism]''. Transaction Books, New Brunswick, NJ 1979&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcho-capitalism]] developed from radical anti-state [[libertarianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]], drawing from [[Austrian School]] economics, study of [[law and economics]] and [[public choice theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Edward Stringham, [http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=53&amp;articleID=686 ''Anarchy, State, and Public Choice''], Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; while the burgeoning [[feminism|feminist]] and [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] movements also produced anarchist offshoots.

[[Anarcha-feminism]] developed as a synthesis of [[radical feminism]] and anarchism that views [[patriarchy]] (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of compulsory government. It was inspired by the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], and [[Dora Marsden]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticise and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and [[gender role]]s. [[Green anarchism]] (or eco-anarchism)&lt;ref&gt;David Pepper (1996). [http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=PQOvkB7UoWgC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq= Modern Environmentalism] p. 44.

Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and whose main contemporary currents are [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[social ecology]]. [[Anarcho-pacifism]] is a tendency which rejects the use of violence in the struggle for social change.&lt;ref name=&quot;ppu.org.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt; It developed &quot;mostly in the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]], before and during the [[World War II|Second World War]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt;

[[Post-left anarchy]] is a tendency which seeks to distance itself from traditional [[left-wing politics]] and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. [[Post-anarchism]] is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought drawing from diverse ideas including [[post-modernism]], [[autonomist marxism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[Situationist International|situationism]] and [[postcolonialism]].

Another recent form of anarchism critical of formal anarchist movements is [[insurrectionary anarchism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;joeblack&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainfos.ca/06/jul/ainfos00232.html |title=&quot;Anarchism, insurrections and insurrectionalism&quot; by Joe Black |publisher=Ainfos.ca |date=2006-07-19 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which advocates informal organization and active resistance to the state; its proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]].

==Topics of interest in anarchist theory==
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.

===Free love===
{{Main|Free love|Anarchism and sex/love|Anarcha-feminism|Queer anarchism}}
[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|thumb|300x300px|French [[individualist anarchist]] [[Emile Armand]] (1872–1962), who propounded the virtues of free love in the Parisian anarchist milieu of the early 20th century]]
An important current within anarchism is [[Free love]].&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html |title=The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy |publisher=Ncc-1776.org |date=1996-12-01 |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to [[Josiah Warren]] and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; The most important American free love journal was ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' (1883–1907) edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]],&lt;ref&gt;Joanne E. Passet, &quot;Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism,&quot; in: ''Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229–250.&lt;/ref&gt; but also there existed [[Ezra Heywood]] and Angela Heywood's ''[[The Word (free love)|''The Word'']]'' (1872–1890, 1892–1893).&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; ''[[Free Society]]'' (1895-1897 as ''The Firebrand''; 1897-1904 as ''Free Society'') was a major anarchist newspaper in the [[United States]] at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldman-MSF-551&quot;&gt;&quot;''Free Society'' was the principal English-language forum for anarchist ideas in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century.&quot; ''Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902-1909'', p.551.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication staunchly advocated [[free love]] and [[women's rights]], and critiqued &quot;[[Comstockery]]&quot; -- censorship of sexual information.Also [[M. E. Lazarus]] was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt;

In New York's [[Greenwich Village]], [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Sochen, June. 1972. ''The New Woman: Feminism in Greenwich Village 1910–1920.'' New York: Quadrangle.&lt;/ref&gt; and the openly bisexual radical [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and the lesbian anarchist [[Margaret Anderson]] were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by [[Emma Goldman]], among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman &quot;has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jonathan Ned. ''Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.'' (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, before Goldman, [[heterosexual]] anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal ''[[Der arme Teufel]]''.

In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was [[Emile Armand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf |title=E. Armand and &quot;la camaraderie amoureuse&quot; – Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;/&gt; In Germany the [[stirner]]ists [[Adolf Brand]] and [[John Henry Mackay]] were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]].

More recently, the British [[anarcho-pacifist]] [[Alex Comfort]] gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''. The issue of [[free love]] has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as ''Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire'' (2000) and ''L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques'' (2002).

===Libertarian education===
[[File:Fransisco Ferrer Guardia.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], [[Catalan people|Catalan]] anarchist pedagogue]] [[Max Stirner]] wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called ''[[The False Principle of our Education]]''. In it Stirner names his educational principle &quot;personalist,&quot; explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create &quot;free men, sovereign characters,&quot; by which he means &quot;eternal characters...who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html |title=&quot;The False Principle of our Education&quot; by Max Stirner |publisher=Tmh.floonet.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and [[Freethought|free-thinker]] [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established &quot;modern&quot; or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Geoffrey C. Fidler |year=1985 |month=Spring/Summer |title=The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: &quot;Por la Verdad y la Justicia&quot; |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=1/2 |pages=103–132 |id= |url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0018-2680%28198521%2F22%2925%3A1%2F2%3C103%3ATEMMOF%3E2.0.CO%3B2-R&amp;size=LARGE&amp;origin=JSTOR-enlargePage |doi=10.2307/368893 |jstor=10.2307/368893 |publisher=History of Education Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools' stated goal was to &quot;[[Popular education|educate the working class]] in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting&quot;. Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in &quot;freedom in education&quot;, education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |title=Francisco Ferrer's Modern School |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Bookchin]] wrote: &quot;This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7, ''[[anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchosyndicalism]], The New Ferment''. In Murray Bookchin, ''The Spanish anarchists: the heroic years, 1868–1936''. AK Press, 1998, p.115. ISBN 1-873176-04-X&lt;/ref&gt; La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of ''[[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]]'' in the [[United States]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;/&gt; [[Cuba]], [[South America]] and [[London]]. The first of these was started in [[New York City]] in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901.

Another libertarian tradition is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Purkis | first = Jon | title = Changing Anarchism | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-7190-6694-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent (2010) ''Modern Political Ideologies'', 3rd edition, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell p.129&lt;/ref&gt; However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political [[class struggle]]-approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Judith |last=Suissa |url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1288/anarchy-in-the-classroom|title= Anarchy in the classroom |journal=[[The New Humanist]] |volume=120 |issue=5 |month=September/October |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to organizing schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]] was popularized by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Illich| first=Ivan |title=Deschooling Society |place= New York|publisher= Harper and Row| year= 1971| isbn= 0-06-012139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal issues and debates===
[[File:Gadewar.jpg|thumb|The use of [[anarchism and violence|violence]] is a subject of much dispute in anarchism.]]&lt;!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. --&gt;
Anarchism is a [[philosophy]] which embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],&lt;ref name=oxcom/&gt; [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[ethical egoism|enlightened self-interest]], [[veganarchism|veganism]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), contemporary anarchists espouse alternative [[direct action]] methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, Carmen García Trevijano, [http://books.google.es/books?id=s9iwZGv44psC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Enciclopedia+teor%C3%ADa+pol%C3%ADtica&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA57,M1 ''Oxford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].{{-}}

'''Autism''' is a [[Neurodevelopmental disorder|disorder of neural development]] characterized by impaired [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]] and [[communication]], and by restricted and repetitive behavior. These signs all begin before a child is three years old.&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00/&gt; Autism affects information processing in the [[Human brain|brain]] by altering how nerve cells and their [[synapse]]s connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; It is one of three recognized disorders in the [[autism spectrum]] (ASDs), the other two being [[Asperger syndrome]], which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and [[PDD-NOS|Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified]] (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the [[Heritability of autism|genetics of autism]] are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare [[mutation]]s, or by rare combinations of common genetic variants.&lt;ref name=Abrahams/&gt; In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with [[Teratology|agents that cause birth defects]].&lt;ref name=Arndt/&gt; [[Controversies in autism|Controversies]] surround other proposed environmental [[Causes of autism|causes]], such as [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], [[pesticide]]s or childhood [[vaccine]]s;&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt; the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and lack convincing scientific evidence.&lt;ref name=GerberOffit2009&gt;{{cite journal |author= Gerber JS, Offit PA |title= Vaccines and autism: a tale of shifting hypotheses |journal= Clin Infect Dis |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=456–61 |year=2009 |pmid=19128068 |pmc= 2908388 |doi=10.1086/596476 |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/4/456.full |laysummary=http://www.idsociety.org/Content.aspx?id=13336 |laysource=IDSA |laydate=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[prevalence]] of autism is about 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide; however, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reports approximately 9 per 1,000 children in the United States are diagnosed with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html CDC Data|title=Autism Spectrum Disorders - Data &amp; Statistics|work=[[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]]|date=May 13, 2010|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vaccines/&gt; The number of people diagnosed with autism has increased dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; The signs usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first develop more normally and then [[Regressive autism|regress]].&lt;ref name=Stefanatos/&gt; Early [[Lovaas technique|behavioral]] or cognitive intervention can help autistic children gain self-care, social, and communication skills.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; Although there is no known cure,&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; there have been reported cases of children who recovered.&lt;ref name=Helt/&gt; Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.&lt;ref name=Howlin/&gt; An [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic culture]] has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder.&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Autism is a highly variable [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]&lt;ref name=Geschwind/&gt; that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Rogers SJ |title=What are infant siblings teaching us about autism in infancy? |title.= |journal=Autism Res |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=125–37 |year=2009 |pmid=19582867 |doi=10.1002/aur.81 |pmc=2791538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt; Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

===Social development===
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD; see ''[[#Classification|Classification]]'') from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the [[social communication]] of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with normal [[neural development]], as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]: Seven Paradoxical Tales |author=[[Oliver Sacks|Sacks O]] |publisher=Knopf |year=1995 |isbn=0-679-43785-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.&lt;!-- ref name=Volkmar/ --&gt; Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from [[social norms]]; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and turn taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express oneself, such as the deficiency to point at things.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt; Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2004 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=221–33 |title=Early detection of core deficits in autism |author=Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20046 |pmid=15666338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most autistic children display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than non-autistic children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |year=2004 |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1123–34 |title=Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review |author=Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van IJzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x |pmid=15257669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition.&lt;ref name=Sigman&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Annu Rev Clin Psychol |year=2006 |volume=2 |pages=327–55 |title=Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives |author=Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT |doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210 |pmid=17716073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with mental retardation, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and tantrums. A 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one-third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in non-autistic children with language impairments.&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt; A 2008 Swedish study found that, of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD, those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Interpers Violence |year=2008 |title=Risk factors for violent offending in autism spectrum disorder: a national study of hospitalized individuals |author=Långström N, Grann M, Ruchkin V, Sjöstedt G, Fazel S |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=1358–70 |doi=10.1177/0886260508322195 |pmid=18701743 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Intellect Disabil Res |year=2006 |volume=50 |issue=9 |pages=621–32 |title=The ComFor: an instrument for the indication of augmentative communication in people with autism and intellectual disability |author=Noens I, van Berckelaer-Onnes I, Verpoorten R, van Duijn G |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2788.2006.00807.x |pmid=16901289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [[babbling]], unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ([[echolalia]])&lt;ref name=Landa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; or [[Pronoun reversal|reverse pronouns]].&lt;ref name=Kanner1943/&gt; [[Joint attention]] seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD:&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1183–215 |title=Identification and evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorders |author=Johnson CP, Myers SM, Council on Children with Disabilities |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2361 |pmid=17967920 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1183 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.&lt;ref name=Landa&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |title=Early communication development and intervention for children with autism |author=Landa R |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20134 |pmid=17326115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Pediatr Clin North Am |year=2007 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=469–81 |title=Language disorders: autism and other pervasive developmental disorders |author=Tager-Flusberg H, Caronna E |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.011 |pmid=17543905 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===

Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman/&gt; categorizes as follows.

[[File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|alt=Young boy asleep on a bed, facing the camera, with only the head visible and the body off-camera. On the bed behind the boy's head is a dozen or so toys carefully arranged in a line, ordered by size.|A young boy with autism, and the precise line of toys he made]]

*'''[[Stereotypy]]''' is repetitive movement, such as hand flapping, making sounds, head rolling, or body rocking.
*'''[[Compulsive behavior]]''' is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in stacks or lines.
*'''Sameness''' is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
*'''[[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]''' involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |volume=37 |issue=5 |pages=855–66 |title=The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders |author=Lam KSL, Aman MG |doi=10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z |pmid=17048092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Restricted behavior''' is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy, or game.
*'''[[Self-injury]]''' includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as eye poking, [[skin picking]], hand biting, and head banging.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; A 2007 study reported that self-injury at some point affected about 30% of children with ASD.&lt;ref name=Dominick/&gt;
No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2000 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=237–43 |title=Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation |author=Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH |doi=10.1023/A:1005596502855 |pmid=11055459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other symptoms===
Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.&lt;ref name=Filipek&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Filipek PA, Accardo PJ, Baranek GT ''et al.'' |author.= |title=The screening and diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=1999 |volume=29 |issue=6 |pages=439–84 |doi=10.1023/A:1021943802493 |pmid=10638459 }} This paper represents a consensus of representatives from nine professional and four parent organizations in the US.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt;

Of the five PDD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [[PDD not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS; also called ''atypical autism'') is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Volkmar FR, State M, Klin A |title=Autism and autism spectrum disorders: diagnostic issues for the coming decade |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=1–2 |pages=108–15 |year=2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02010.x |pmid=19220594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in [[language development]].&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00/&gt; The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the ''autism spectrum disorders'' (ASD)&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; or sometimes the ''autistic disorders'',&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Freitag CM |title=The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature |journal=Mol Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=2–22 |year=2007 |doi=10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 |pmid=17033636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'', ''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''. In this article, ''autism'' refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, ''autism'', ''ASD'', and ''PDD'' are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism [[phenotype]], which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like [[Trait (biology)|traits]], such as avoiding eye contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Piven J, Palmer P, Jacobi D, Childress D, Arndt S |title=Broader autism phenotype: evidence from a family history study of multiple-incidence autism families |journal=Am J Psychiatry |year=1997 |volume=154 |issue=2 |pages=185–90 |pmid=9016266 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/154/2/185.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manifestations of autism cover a wide [[Spectrum disorder|spectrum]], ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, [[mentally disabled]], and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, [[pedantic]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Happé F |title=Understanding assets and deficits in autism: why success is more interesting than failure |journal=Psychologist |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=540–7 |year=1999 |url=http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Geschwind-2009/&gt; Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or [[high-functioning autism]] (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on [[IQ]] thresholds,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=[[Simon Baron-Cohen|Baron-Cohen S]] |title=The hyper-systemizing, assortative mating theory of autism |journal=Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry |year=2006 |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=865–72 |doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.010 |pmid=16519981 |url=http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Neuropsychophamacology.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial.

It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms.&lt;ref name=Fractionable/&gt; However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.&lt;ref name=Fractionable&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Happé F, Ronald A |title=The 'fractionable autism triad': a review of evidence from behavioural, genetic, cognitive and neural research |journal=[[Neuropsychol Rev]] |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=287–304 |year=2008 |pmid=18956240 |doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9076-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HappeTime/&gt;

==Mechanism==
Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.&lt;!-- ref name=Penn/ --&gt; How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the [[pathophysiology]] of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the [[neuropsychological]] linkages between brain structures and behaviors.&lt;ref name=Penn&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Penn HE |title=Neurobiological correlates of autism: a review of recent research |journal=Child Neuropsychol |year=2006 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=57–79 |doi=10.1080/09297040500253546 |pmid=16484102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

Unlike many other brain disorders such as [[Parkinson's]], autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular, cellular, or systems level; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways, or is (like intellectual disability) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Geschwind&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Geschwind DH |title=Autism: many genes, common pathways? |title.= |journal=Cell |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=391–5 |year=2008 |pmid=18984147 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.10.016 |pmc=2756410 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=85–95 |title=The study of autism as a distributed disorder |author=Müller RA |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20141 |pmid=17326118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product.&lt;ref name=Amaral&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Trends Neurosci |year=2008 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=137–45 |title=Neuroanatomy of autism |author=[[David Amaral|Amaral DG]], Schumann CM, Nordahl CW |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2007.12.005 |pmid=18258309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroanatomical]] studies and the associations with [[teratogens]] strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception.&lt;ref name=Arndt/&gt; This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Brain Pathol |year=2007 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=422–33 |title=The neuropathology of autism |author=Casanova MF |doi=10.1111/j.1750-3639.2007.00100.x |pmid=17919128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just after birth, the brains of autistic children tend to grow faster than usual, followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood.

Interactions between the [[immune system]] and the [[nervous system]] begin early during the [[Human embryogenesis|embryonic stage]] of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response.

The [[mirror neuron system]] (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;MNS and autism:

From studies based on [[event-related potential]]s, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientiation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for non-social stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Jeste SS, Nelson CA 3rd |title=Event related potentials in the understanding of autism spectrum disorders: an analytical review |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=495–510 |year=2009 |pmid=18850262 |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0652-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[magnetoencephalography]] studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Roberts TP, Schmidt GL, Egeth M ''et al.'' |author.= |title=Electrophysiological signatures: magnetoencephalographic studies of the neural correlates of language impairment in autism spectrum disorders |journal=Int J Psychophysiol |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=149–60 |year=2008 |pmid=18336941 |doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.01.012 |pmc=2397446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropsychology===
Two major categories of [[cognitive]] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in [[social cognition]]. The [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing;&lt;ref name=E-S-theory/&gt; this extension is controversial, as many studies contradict the idea that baby boys and girls respond differently to people and objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Spelke ES |title=Sex differences in intrinsic aptitude for mathematics and science?: a critical review |journal=Am Psychol |volume=60 |issue=9 |pages=950–8 |year=2005 |pmid=16366817 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.60.9.950 |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/pdfs/spelke2005.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories are somewhat related to the earlier [[theory of mind]] approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic children's atypical responses to the [[Sally–Anne test]] for reasoning about others' motivations,&lt;ref name=E-S-theory&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Baron-Cohen S |title=Autism: the empathizing–systemizing (E-S) theory |journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci |volume=1156 |pages=68–80 |year=2009 |pmid=19338503 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x |url=http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in ''[[#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]'' maps well to the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Iacoboni/&gt; However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Hamilton AFdC |title=Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=881–92 |year=2009 |pmid=19508497 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing. [[Executive dysfunction]] hypothesizes that autistic behavior results in part from deficits in [[working memory]], planning, [[Inhibition Theory|inhibition]], and other forms of executive function.&lt;ref name=Kenworthy/&gt; Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=O'Hearn K, Asato M, Ordaz S, Luna B |title=Neurodevelopment and executive function in autism |journal=Dev Psychopathol |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=1103–32 |year=2008 |pmid=18838033 |doi=10.1017/S0954579408000527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Hill EL |title=Executive dysfunction in autism |journal=Trends Cogn Sci |year=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=26–32 |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2004.01.001 |pmid=14697400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure&lt;ref name=Kenworthy&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kenworthy L, Yerys BE, Anthony LG, Wallace GL |title=Understanding executive control in autism spectrum disorders in the lab and in the real world |journal=Neuropsychol Rev |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=320–38 |year=2008 |pmid=18956239 |doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9077-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children.&lt;ref name=Sigman/&gt;

==Screening==
About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months.&lt;ref name=Landa3/&gt; According to an article in the ''Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders'', failure to meet any of the following milestones ''&quot;is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome.&quot;''&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt;
*No [[babbling]] by 12 months.
*No [[Gesture|gesturing]] (pointing, waving bye-bye, etc.) by 12 months.
*No single words by 16 months.
*No 2-word spontaneous (''not just [[echolalia|echolalic]]'') phrases by 24 months.
*''Any'' loss of ''any'' language or social skills, ''at any age''.
US and Japanese practice is to [[Screening (medicine)|screen]] all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on M-CHAT and its predecessor CHAT on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] (many false-negatives) but good [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] (few false-positives).&lt;ref name=Landa3/&gt; It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Wetherby AM, Brosnan-Maddox S, Peace V, Newton L |title=Validation of the Infant–Toddler Checklist as a broadband screener for autism spectrum disorders from 9 to 24 months of age |journal=Autism |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=487–511 |year=2008 |pmid=18805944 |doi=10.1177/1362361308094501 |pmc=2663025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Acta Paediatr |year=2008 |volume=97 |issue=5 |pages=539–40 |title=The challenge of screening for autism spectrum disorder in a culturally diverse society |author=Wallis KE, Pinto-Martin J |doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00720.x |pmid=18373717 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[genetic screening]] for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and [[dysmorphic feature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Lintas C, Persico AM |title=Autistic phenotypes and genetic testing: state-of-the-art for the clinical geneticist |journal=J Med Genet |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2009 |pmid=18728070 |pmc=2603481 |doi=10.1136/jmg.2008.060871 |url=http://jmg.bmj.com/content/46/1/1.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. Onset must be prior to age three years, with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome]] or [[childhood disintegrative disorder]].&lt;ref name=DSM-IV-TR-299.00&gt;{{vcite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |chapterurl=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |publisher=&lt;!--comment to foil Citation bot--&gt; |location=&lt;!--comment to foil Citation bot--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ICD-10]] uses essentially the same definition.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0&gt;{{vcite web |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f84 |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-10-10 |work=ICD-10: International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems: Tenth Revision |publisher=World Health Organization |title=F84.

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]] (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The [[Childhood Autism Rating Scale]] (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;

A [[pediatrician]] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated [[medical conditions]].&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; A pediatric [[neuropsychologist]] is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.&lt;ref name=Kanne&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kanne SM, Randolph JK, Farmer JE |title=Diagnostic and assessment findings: a bridge to academic planning for children with autism spectrum disorders |journal=Neuropsychol Rev |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=367–84 |year=2008 |pmid=18855144 |doi=10.1007/s11065-008-9072-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[differential diagnosis]] for ASD at this stage might also consider [[mental retardation]], [[hearing impairment]], and a [[specific language impairment]]&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; such as [[Landau–Kleffner syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Dev Med Child Neurol |year=2000 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=349–53 |title=Autistic regression and Landau–Kleffner syndrome: progress or confusion? |title.= |author=Mantovani JF |doi=10.1017/S0012162200210621 |pmid=10855658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as [[Mood disorder|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Matson JL, Neal D |title=Cormorbidity: diagnosing comorbid psychiatric conditions |journal=Psychiatr Times |volume=26 |issue=4 |year=2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1403043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clinical genetics]] evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Genet Med |year=2008 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=4–12 |title=Genetics evaluation for the etiologic diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders |author=Schaefer GB, Mendelsohn NJ |doi=10.1097/GIM.0b013e31815efdd7 |pmid=18197051 |laysummary=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php |laysource=Medical News Today |laydate=2008-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and [[fragile X]] testing.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; A [[genotype]]-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Ledbetter DH |title=Cytogenetic technology—genotype and phenotype |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=359 |issue=16 |pages=1728–30 |year=2008 |pmid=18784093 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe0806570 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Am J Med Genet C Semin Med Genet |year=2006 |volume=142C |issue=1 |pages=52–7 |title=Genetic counseling and ethical issues for autism |author=McMahon WM, Baty BJ, Botkin J |doi=10.1002/ajmg.c.30082 |pmid=16419100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metabolic]] and [[neuroimaging]] tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt;

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.&lt;ref name=Landa3&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Nat Clin Pract Neurol |year=2008 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=138–47 |title=Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life |author=Landa RJ |doi=10.1038/ncpneuro0731 |pmid=18253102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.&lt;ref name=Dover&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |year=2007 |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=540–5 |title=How to diagnose autism |author=Dover CJ, Le Couteur A |doi=10.1136/adc.2005.086280 |pmid=17515625 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 US study found the average age of formal ASD diagnosis was 5.7 years, far above recommendations, and that 27% of children remained undiagnosed at age 8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Shattuck PT, Durkin M, Maenner M ''et al.'' |author.= |title=Timing of identification among children with an autism spectrum disorder: findings from a population-based surveillance study |journal=J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=474–83 |year=2009 |pmid=19318992 |doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e31819b3848 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |publisher=National Autistic Society |title=Diagnosis: how can it benefit me as an adult? |title.= |year=2005 |url=http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=8018 |accessdate=2008-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Shattuck PT, Grosse SD |title=Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders |journal=Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=129–35 |doi=10.1002/mrdd.20143 |pmid=17563895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [[visually impaired]], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or [[blindism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |title=Visual impairment and autism: current questions and future research |author=Cass H |journal=Autism |year=1998 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=117–38 |doi=10.1177/1362361398022002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other conditions are common in children with autism.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; They include:

*'''[[Anxiety disorder]]s''' are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%.

*'''Preempted diagnoses'''.

These most commonly include symptoms of [[insomnia]] such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings.

A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The ''[[Table talk (literature)|Table Talk]]'' of [[Martin Luther]], compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Autism |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13–23 |year=1997 |doi=10.1177/1362361397011004 |title=The history of ideas on autism: legends, myths and reality |author=[[Lorna Wing|Wing L]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |author=Miles M |year=2005 |title=Martin Luther and childhood disability in 16th century Germany: what did he write? what did he say? |title.= |publisher=Independent Living Institute |url=http://www.independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html |accessdate=2008-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Houston R, Frith U |title=Autism in History: The Case of Hugh Blair of Borgue |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=0-631-22089-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wild Boy of Aveyron]], a [[feral child]] caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard|Jean Itard]] treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry |year=2004 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=201–8 |title=The history of autism |author=Wolff S |doi=10.1007/s00787-004-0363-5 |pmid=15365889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. He derived it from the Greek word ''autós'' (αὐτός, meaning ''self''), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to &quot;autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kuhn R; tr. Cahn CH |title=Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology |journal=Hist Psychiatry |volume=15 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=361–6 |doi=10.1177/0957154X04044603 |pmid=15386868 }} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–7 |trans_title=The psychically abnormal child |author=[[Hans Asperger|Asperger H]] |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name=Kanner1943&gt;{{vcite journal |author=[[Leo Kanner|Kanner L]] |title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal=Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–50 |year=1943 }} Reprinted in {{vcite journal |year=1968 |journal=Acta Paedopsychiatr |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=100–36 |pmid=4880460 |author=&lt;!-- Pacify Citation bot. --&gt; |title=&lt;!-- Pacify Citation bot. --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name=HappeTime/&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name=Lyons&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=2022–3 |title=Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism |author=Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3 |pmid=17922179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to &quot;[[refrigerator mother]]s&quot;.

[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|Percentage of diffusely reflected sun light in relation to various surface conditions of the Earth]]

'''Albedo''' ({{IPA-en|ælˈbiːdoʊ}}), or ''reflection coefficient'', is the [[diffuse reflection|diffuse reflectivity]] or reflecting power of a surface. It is defined as the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Being a [[Dimensionless number|dimensionless]] fraction, it may also be expressed as a percentage, and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflecting power of a perfectly black surface, to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.

Albedo depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incoming radiation.  Exceptions are [[Lambertian]] surfaces, which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function, so their albedo does not depend on the incident distribution. In practice, a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) may be required to characterize the scattering properties of a surface accurately, although the albedo is a very useful first approximation.

The albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]], as well as in computer graphics and computer vision. The average overall albedo of Earth, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30 to 35%, because of the covering by clouds, but varies widely locally across the surface, depending on the geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Encyclopedia, 3rd ed., Thompson Gale, 2003, ISBN 0-7876-5486-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is derived from [[Latin]] ''albedo'' &quot;whiteness&quot;, in turn from ''albus'' &quot;white&quot;, and was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''Photometria''.

Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow, to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, while desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html Albedo - from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of the [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot; /&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.

The classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature [[feedback]]. If a snow-covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

[[File:Ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|200px|left|2003-2004 mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo]]
The Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments onboard the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a [[mathematical model]] of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance.  (e.&amp;nbsp;g.,
.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot; /&gt;)

The Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15°C. For the frozen (more reflective) planet the average temperature is below -40°C&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot; /&gt; (If only all continents being completely covered by glaciers - the mean temperature is about 0°C&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot; /&gt;). The simulation for (more absorptive) aquaplanet shows the average temperature close to 27°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot; /&gt;

===White-sky and black-sky albedo===
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular solar [[Celestial coordinate system|zenith angle]] &lt;math&gt;{\theta_i}&lt;/math&gt; can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

Albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar \bar \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Directional-hemispherical reflectance]] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]] as white sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot; /&gt;

==Astronomical albedo==
The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[natural satellites|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.86. Many small objects in the outer solar system&lt;ref name=&quot;tnoalbedo&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

  |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily [[space weathering|space weathered]] surface containing some [[organic compound]]s.

The overall albedo of the [[Moon]] is around 0.12, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;medkeff&quot; /&gt; While such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the [[regolith]] surfaces of airless solar system bodies.

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the [[opposition effect]] of [[regolith]] surfaces.

The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, [[Absolute magnitude#Absolute magnitude for planets (H)|absolute magnitude]] and diameter is:&lt;ref name=&quot;bruton&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometres, and ''H'' is the absolute magnitude.

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==
===The tropics===
Although the albedo-temperature effect is best known in colder regions on Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions which receive consistently more sunlight.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Small scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear lighter color clothes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;[http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html Health and Safety: Be Cool! (August 1997)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trees===
Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby could produce localized climate cooling (ignoring the lost evaporative cooling effect of trees). [[Cloud feedback]]s further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 while [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt;

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt;

===Snow===
Snow albedos can be as high as 0.9; this, however, is for the ideal example: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 0.8.  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo [[positive feedback]]). [[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nat. Geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;Changing Greenland - Melt Zone&quot;] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic]]'' June, 2010, accessed July 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).
[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20 C (refractive index=1.333)]]
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresnel&quot; /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it increases tremendously at high angles of incident light such as occur on the illuminated side of the Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Since the light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh ‘black’ ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] is an important factor in the global warming effect. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth | LiveScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;uww&quot; /&gt; A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvard&quot;&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992JGR....9714565C The Kuwait oil fires as seen by Landsat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on the Earth’s radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change [[cloud]] properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda&quot;&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As per &lt;ref name=&quot;DOMINICK&quot; /&gt; the effects are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda 1&quot;&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types of albedo==
[[Single scattering albedo]] is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

Albedo also refers to the white, spongy inner lining of a [[citrus fruit]] [[Peel (fruit)|rind]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wordsmith&quot; /&gt;  According to Dr. Renee M. Goodrich, associate professor of food science and human nutrition at the University of Florida, the albedo is rich in the [[soluble fiber]] [[pectin]] and contains [[vitamin C]].

'''A''' ({{IPAc-en|En-us-A.ogg|eɪ}}; [[English_alphabet#Letter_names|named]] ''a'', plural ''aes'')&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt; is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] and a [[vowel]] in the [[basic modern Latin alphabet]].  It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter [[Alpha]], from which it derives.

==Origins==
&quot;A&quot; can be traced  to a [[pictogram]] of an [[ox]] head in [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] or the [[Proto-Sinaitic alphabet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World Book&quot;/&gt;

|}

In 1600 B.C., the [[Phoenician alphabet]]'s letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name must have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] or [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] [[aleph]].

|}
When the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the [[glottal stop]] that the letter had denoted in [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]], so they used the sign to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and kept its name with a minor change ([[alpha (letter)|alpha]]). In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the modern [[Latin alphabet]] used to write many languages, including [[English language|English]].

[[Image:LowercaseA.svg|right|thumb|200|Typographic variants include a double-story and single-story '''a'''.]]
The letter has two [[lower case|minuscule]] (lower-case) forms. The form used in most current [[handwriting]] consists of a circle and vertical stoke ({{Unicode|&quot;ɑ&quot;}}), called [[Latin alpha]] or &quot;script a&quot;. Most printed material uses a form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it ({{Unicode|&quot;a&quot;}}). Both derive from the [[majuscule]] (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the Uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

==Usage==
{{main|a (disambiguation)}}
In English, &quot;a&quot; by itself frequently denotes the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/æ/}}) as in ''pad'', the [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/ɑː/}}) as in ''father'', or, in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong {{IPA|/eɪ/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'', due to effects of the [[great vowel shift]].

In most other languages that use the Latin alphabet, &quot;a&quot; denotes an [[open front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/a/}}). In the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]], variants of &quot;a&quot; denote various [[vowel]]s. In [[X-SAMPA]], capital &quot;A&quot; denotes the [[open back unrounded vowel]] and lowercase &quot;a&quot; denotes the [[open front unrounded vowel]].

&quot;A&quot; is the third common used letter in English, and the second most common in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]]. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English tend to be ‹a›s, while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trinity College&quot; /&gt;

&quot;A&quot; is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; A grade for clean restaurants; [[A-List]] celebrities, etc.  Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.sciencealert.com.au/news/20100903-20689.html |title=Letters affect exam results |date=9 March 2010 |publisher=British Psychological Society |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[turned a|turned &quot;a&quot;]], {{IPA|‹ɐ›}} is used by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] for the [[near-open central vowel]], while a turned capital &quot;A&quot; (&quot;∀&quot;) is used in [[predicate logic]] to specify [[universal quantification]].

}}

==Computing codes==
In [[Unicode]], the [[majuscule|capital]] &quot;A&quot; is codepoint U+0041 and the [[lower case]] &quot;a&quot; is U+0061.&lt;ref name=&quot;unicode&quot; /&gt;

The [[ASCII]] code for capital &quot;A&quot; is 65 and for lower case &quot;a&quot; is 97; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 01000001 and 01100001, respectively.

The [[EBCDIC]] code for capital &quot;A&quot; is 193 and for lowercase &quot;a&quot; is 129; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 11000001 and 10000001, respectively.

The [[numeric character reference]]s in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] are &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#65;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#97;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for upper and lower case, respectively.

'''Alabama''' ({{IPAc-en|en-us-Alabama.ogg|ˌ|æ|l|ə|ˈ|b|æ|m|ə}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the [[Southern United States|southeastern region]] of the [[United States of America]]. It is bordered by [[Tennessee]] to the north, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the east, [[Florida]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the south, and [[Mississippi]] to the west. Alabama ranks 30th in total land area and ranks second in the size of its inland waterways. The state ranks 23rd in population with 4.7&amp;nbsp;million residents in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01000.html |title=Alabama Quick Facts |accessdate= December 30, 2010 |work=State and County Quick Facts |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[American Civil War]] until [[World War II]], Alabama, like many Southern states, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s, while urban interests and [[African Americans]] were under-represented.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071017192719/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |archivedate=2007-10-17 |title=George Mason University, United States Election Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary, accessed March 10, 2008 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following World War II, Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from agriculture to diversified interests in heavy manufacturing, mineral extraction, education, and technology.  In addition, the establishment or expansion of multiple military installations, primarily those of the [[U.S. Army]] and [[U.S. Air Force]], added to state jobs.

Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the ''[[Northern Flicker|Yellowhammer]] State'', after the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]]. Alabama is also known as the &quot;[[Dixie|Heart of Dixie]]&quot;. The [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] is the [[Longleaf Pine]], the [[List of U.S. state flowers|state flower]] is the [[Camellia]]. The capital of Alabama is [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].  The largest city by population is [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. The largest city by total land area is [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. The oldest city is [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], founded by [[French people|French]] [[colonists]].

==Etymology==
The [[Alabama (people)]], a [[Muskogean]]-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River]]s on the upper reaches of the [[Alabama River]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=0-8173-0231-X |oclc=10724679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; served as the [[etymology|etymological source]] of the names of the river and state. In the [[Alabama language]], the word for an Alabama person is ''Albaamo'' (or variously ''Albaama'' or ''Albàamo'' in different dialects; the plural form &quot;Alabama persons&quot; is ''Albaamaha'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sylestine, Cora; Hardy; Heather; and Montler, Timothy |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=0-292-73077-2 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Alabama'' is believed to have originated from the [[Choctaw language]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rogers |first=William W.|coauthors=Robert D.

Although the origin of ''Alabama'' could be discerned, sources disagree on its meaning. An 1842 article in the ''Jacksonville Republican'' originated the idea that the meaning was &quot;Here We Rest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt; This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of [[Alexander Beaufort Meek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;  Experts in the [[Muskogean languages]] have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Read&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;  Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw ''alba'' (meaning &quot;plants&quot; or &quot;weeds&quot;) and ''amo'' (meaning &quot;to cut&quot;, &quot;to trim&quot;, or &quot;to gather&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rogers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADAH1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swanton1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanton |first=John R. |authorlink=John R.

===Indigenous peoples, early history===

[[Indigenous peoples]] of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization. Trade with the Northeast via the [[Ohio River]] began during the Burial Mound Period (1000&amp;nbsp;BC–AD&amp;nbsp;700) and continued until [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NewYorkTimesAlmanac&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://travel2.nytimes.com/2004/07/15/travel/NYT_ALMANAC_US_ALABAMA.html |title = Alabama |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |date= 2006-08-11 |work = The New York Times Almanac 2004|publisher = The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agrarian [[Mississippian culture]] covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 AD, with one of its major centers being at the [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] in [[Moundville, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Welch |first = Paul D. |title = Moundville's Economy |publisher = [[University of Alabama Press]] |year = 1991 |isbn = 0-8173-0512-2 |oclc = 21330955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Walthall |first = John A. |title = Prehistoric Indians of the Southeast-Archaeology of Alabama and the Middle South |publisher = [[University of Alabama Press]] |year = 1990 |isbn = 0-8173-0552-1 |oclc = 26656858 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] recovered from [[archaeological]] excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] (SECC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Townsend |first = Richard F. |title = [[Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand]] |publisher = [[Yale University Press]] |year = 2004 |isbn = 0-300-10601-7 |oclc = 56633574 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to [[Mesoamerica]]n culture, but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the [[religion]] of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editors = F.

Among the historical tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were  [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Cherokee]], and the [[Muskogean]]-speaking [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]] (''Alibamu''), [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Creek people|Creek]], [[Koasati]], and [[Mobilian Jargon|Mobile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/alabama/ |title = Alabama Indian Tribes |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |date = Updated 2006 |work= Indian Tribal Records |publisher= AccessGenealogy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European settlement===
The [[France|French]] founded the first European settlement in the region at [[Old Mobile Site|Old Mobile]], in 1702.&lt;ref name=&quot;US50&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.theus50.com/alabama/ |title= Alabama State History |accessdate= 2006-09-23 |date= |work= |publisher = theUS50.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area was French from 1702 to 1763; part of British [[West Florida]] from 1763 to 1780. Thomas Bassett was the first British settler in the state. He settled near what is now [[Tombigbee River]] in [[Washington County, Alabama|Washington County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.state.al.us/aha/markers/washington.html Alabama Historical Association Marker Program: Washington County&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Alabama became part of Spanish West Florida from 1780 to 1810; part of the independent [[Republic of West Florida]] for a short time (90 days); annexed by the U.S. and added to the [[Territory of Orleans]] (1810); and, finally, added to the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1812. Throughout these later developments, however, the Spanish had kept a nominal (although largely ignored) governmental presence in the region, based out of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]. When [[Andrew Jackson]]'s forces occupied Mobile in 1814 —while preparing for the [[Battle of New Orleans]] —he demonstrated the United States' ''[[de facto]]'' authority over the region, effectively ending Spanish governance (though not its claim), while gaining an unencumbered passage to the gulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;StateMaster&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.statemaster.com/graph-T/bac_sum |title= AL-Alabama |accessdate= 2006-09-23 |date= |work= Landscapes and History by state |publisher= StateMaster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area making up today's northern and central Alabama, known as the [[Yazoo lands]], had been claimed by the [[Province of Georgia]] after 1763. Following the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]], it remained a part of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|state of Georgia]] —although heavily disputed. Conflicting claims to the area were held, first by several [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[tribe]]s (most notably the [[Cherokee]] and [[Yazoo tribe|Yazoo]]), by other states (e.g. [[South Carolina]]); and by the [[Federal government of the United States|US federal government]]; [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[Spain]]. In 1802, the region was joined to the [[Mississippi Territory]].  Individual statehood was delayed, however, by the territory's lack of a coastline.

===Statehood, Civil War and Reconstruction===
Alabama became the twenty-second state —admitted to the Union in 1819.  Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men. Settlers rapidly arrived to take advantage of the fertile soil. Southeastern planters and traders from the [[Upper South]] brought [[slavery|slaves]] with them as the cotton [[plantations]] expanded. The economy of the central &quot;[[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]]&quot; (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large [[cotton]] [[plantations]] whose owners' wealth grew largely from slave labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt; The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became [[subsistence farmers]]. The 1860 census records show that enslaved Africans comprised 45% of the state's total population of 964,201. There were only 2,690 [[Freedman|free persons of color]] living in Alabama at the time.

On January 11, 1861, Alabama [[secession|seceded]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and joined the [[Confederate States of America]]. While few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000&amp;nbsp;soldiers to the [[American Civil War]]. Alabama's slaves were freed by the 13th&amp;nbsp;Amendment in 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistDocs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.historicaldocuments.com/13thAmendment.htm |title = 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution: Abolition of Slavery (1865) |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |year = 2005 |work = Historical Documents |publisher = HistoricalDocuments.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the new state legislators created a public school system for the first time, as well as establishing some welfare institutions to help its people.  Alabama was officially restored to the Union in 1868.

After the Civil War, the state was still chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton.  Planters resisted working with free labor during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and sought to re-establish controls over [[freedmen]]. In the early years the [[Ku Klux Klan]] had numerous independent chapters in Alabama that attacked freedmen and other Republicans.  After it was suppressed, [[insurgent]] whites organized [[paramilitary]] groups, such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and [[White League]], that acted more openly to suppress black voting.  Regaining power by the late 1870s, in the last decade of the 19th century, white Democrats passed electoral laws and constitutional amendments to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchise]] most blacks and many poor whites.  Having regained power in the state legislature, Democrats passed [[Jim Crow laws]], including [[racial segregation]] in public facilities, to restore white supremacy.

In 1875, it passed a [[Blaine Amendment]] preventing the use of public money from being used to finance Catholic schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoolreport.com/schoolreport/articles/blaine_7_00.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1900-1960===
In its new constitution of 1901, the legislature effectively disfranchised African Americans through voting restrictions. While the planter class had engaged poor whites in supporting these legislative efforts, the new restrictions resulted in [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchising]] poor whites as well, due mostly to imposition of a cumulative [[poll tax]].  The law was in effect for decades.  By 1941, a total of more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 whites to 520,000 blacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;&gt;Glenn Feldman. ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama''. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage to the African-American community was pervasive, as nearly all its citizens lost the ability to vote. In 1900, 14 Black Belt counties (which were primarily African American) had more than 79,000 voters on the rolls. By June 1, 1903, the number of registered voters had dropped to 1,081. In 1900, Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903,  2,980 had managed to &quot;qualify&quot; to register, although at least 74,000 black voters were [[literate]]. The shut out was long-lasting.&lt;ref name=&quot;epzzsd&quot;/&gt;  The disfranchisement was ended  by African Americans' leading the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and gaining Federal legislation in the mid-1960s to protect their voting and civil rights.  The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] also protected the suffrage of poor whites.

The rural-dominated legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans in the segregated state, but did not relieve them of paying taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://southernspaces.org/2004/black-belt |title = The Black Belt |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |date = 2004-04-19 |work = Southern Spaces Internet Journal |publisher = Emory University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued racial discrimination, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to [[boll weevil]] infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities. They left Alabama in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to industrial jobs and better futures in northern industrial cities. The population growth rate in Alabama (see &quot;Historical Populations&quot; table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910–1920, reflecting the effect of emigration.

At the same time, many rural whites and blacks migrated to the city of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] for work in new industrial jobs. It experienced such rapid growth that it was nicknamed &quot;The Magic City&quot;.  By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th&amp;nbsp;largest city in the U.S. and held more than 30% of the population of the state. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhamwiki.com/w/Birmingham |title=Birmingham |publisher=Bhamwiki |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AlabamaWelcome.JPG|thumb|left|This structure greets drivers visiting the Alabama Welcome Center just inside the AL/GA border off of Interstate 20.]]

Industrial development related to the demands of [[World War II]] brought prosperity.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSpaces&quot;/&gt; Cotton faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base. In the 1960s under Governor [[George Wallace]], many whites in the state opposed integration efforts.

===1960-present===
Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham.

One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services.  Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, &quot;A minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;/&gt;

African Americans were presumed partial to Republicans for historical reasons, but they were disfranchised. White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction. These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with white voters had to run as a Democrat regardless of political beliefs. The state continued as one-party Democratic for more than a century after Reconstruction ended.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} It produced a number of national leaders.

During the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans achieved a protection of voting and other civil rights through the passage of the national [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Finduslaw.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. ''[[De jure]]'' segregation ended in the states as [[Jim Crow laws]] were invalidated or repealed.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDOJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/voting.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070221054512/http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/voting.htm |archivedate = 2007-02-21 |title = Voting Rights |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |date = 2002-01-09 |work = Civil Rights: Law and History |publisher = U.S.Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to properly redistrict by population both the state legislature House and Senate. In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature implemented the Alabama constitution's provision for periodic redistricting based on population.  This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pjhwpa&quot;/&gt;

After 1972, the state's white voters shifted much of their support to Republican candidates in presidential elections (as also occurred in neighboring southern states). Since 1990 the majority of whites in the state have voted increasingly Republican in state elections.  In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southerner&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.southerner.net/v1n1_99/coverstory1.html |title = The New South Rises, Again |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |date = Spring 1999 |work = Civil Rights: Law and History |publisher = Southerner.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama receives an average of {{convert|56|in|mm}} of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300&amp;nbsp;days in the southern part of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;cprgsw&quot;/&gt;

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the United States, with high temperatures averaging over {{convert|90|°F}} throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to [[tropical storm]]s and even [[hurricane]]s. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken. Alabama's all-time record high of {{convert|114|F|C}} was recorded at [[Centerville, Alabama|Centerville]] on September 5, 1925; the all-time record low of {{convert|-27|F|C}} was recorded at [[New Market, Alabama|New Market]] on January 30, 1966.

[[File:Alabama winter 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Though winters in the state are usually mild, nightly freezing occurs frequently in the [[North Alabama]] region. This is shown in this picture taken at the [[State Bank Building, Decatur Branch (Old State Bank)|Old State Bank]] in [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]] during early January.]]

South Alabama reports many [[thunderstorms]]. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60&amp;nbsp;days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent [[lightning]] and large [[hail]] – the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks seventh in the number of deaths from lightning and ninth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.&lt;ref&gt;Lightning Fatalities, Injuries and Damages in the United States, 1990–2003, [http://www.lightningsafety.com/nlsi_lls/fatalities_us.html ]  Retrieved May 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes [[tornado]]es occur – these are common throughout the state, although the peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama, along with [[Kansas]], has the most reported [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF5 tornadoes]] than any other state – according to statistics from the [[National Climatic Data Center]] for the period January 1, 1950, to October 31, 2006. An F5 tornado is the most powerful of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tornadoproject.com/fscale/fscale.htm Fujita scale]. Tornadoproject.com. Retrieved September 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Several long – tracked F5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state except for [[Texas]] and [[Mississippi]]. The [[Super Outbreak]] in March 1974 badly affected Alabama. The northern part of the state – along the Tennessee Valley – is one of the areas in the U.S.most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as [[Dixie Alley]], as distinct from the [[Tornado Alley]] of the Southern Plains. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season (November and December) along with the spring severe weather season.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the [[southeastern United States]], with average January low temperatures around {{convert|40|°F}} in Mobile and around {{convert|32|°F}} in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years.  Historic snowfall events include [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]] and the [[1993 Storm of the Century]].  The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is {{convert|2|in|mm}} per year.  In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

===Race and ancestry===
According to the 2006-2008 [[American Community Survey]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US01&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR5&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-_sse=on American Community Survey: Alabama]. Retrieved 24 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the racial composition of the state was: 70.4% [[White American|White]] ([[Non-Hispanic Whites]]: 68.7%), 26.2% [[African American|Black or African American]], 0.5% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], 1.0% [[Asian American|Asian]], less than 0.1% [[Pacific Islander American|Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific islander]], 0.8% from some other race, and 1.2% from [[Multiracial American|two or more races]]. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics or Latinos]] (of any race) make up 2.7% of the total population.

The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama: [[African American]] (26.2%), [[English American|English]] (23.6%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (7.7%), [[German American|German]] (5.7%), and [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] (2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:WJGw9z2RkkYJ:www.uen.org/Lessonplan/downloadFile.cgi%3Ffile%3D1041-6-15955-AF_Census_Data.pdf%26filename%3DAF_Census_Data.pdf+49,598,035&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgyigzsjZP7yBWdThzodFWP_t7GiFtOGi5W12qTf5nLj_yFzQ0YIKJn2pSyS1TIT-ZjvBx0s057h5mpwrf39HOZmlg3VzoOdaoPrNTdS6x-0SbHnwGXfzVLkDYTyIg7k4E_Zsn8&amp;sig=AHIEtbTzro9GQY6LB1-9ZG9n2r46Epyyaw Data on selected ancestry groups.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/pc80-s1-10/tab02.pdf 1980 United States Census]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;factfinder.census.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US01&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_3YR_G00_DP3YR2&amp;-ds_name=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=false |title=Alabama - Selected Social Characteristics in the United States: 2006-2008 |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2000 Census 621,080 people claimed to be of &quot;American&quot; ancestry, most them are of overwhelmingly [[English American|English]] extraction, however most [[English American|English]] Americans identify simply as having [[United States|American]] ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in many cases since the early 1600s.

In 1984 under the Davis-Strong Act, Alabama established a state Indian Commission and officially recognized seven American Indian tribes, including the [[Echota Cherokee Tribe of Alabama]], which is a [[501 (c)(3)|501 (c3)]] group. It is made up of descendants of the [[Chickamauga Indian|Chickamauga]] [[Cherokee]] and others who managed to evade [[Indian Removal]] in the 1830s. Working with [[Auburn University]], the tribe has begun a revival of the Cherokee language.

===Religion===
Alabama is located in the middle of the [[Bible Belt]]. A majority of people in Alabama today identify as Protestant.  The [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] area is notable for its large percentage of [[Catholics]], owing to the area's founding as part of the [[France|French]] colony of ''[[La Louisiane]]'' and later history under [[Spain|Spanish]] rule.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} As of 2000, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are [[Evangelical Protestant]], [[Mainline Protestant]], and [[Catholic]]. The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] has the highest number of adherents in Alabama with 1,380,121, followed by the [[United Methodist Church]] with 327,734 members, and the [[Catholic Church]] with 150,647 adherents.&lt;ref name=&quot;thearda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/01_2000.asp|title=State Membership Reports |accessdate=2010-06-15 |work= thearda.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the [[Christian]] [[Gospels]]. Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a &quot;full understanding&quot; of their faith and needed no further learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Kirsten |last=Campbell |work=Mobile Register |title=Alabama rates well in biblical literacy |date=2007-03-25 |accessdate=2007-06-02 |page=A1 |publisher=Advance Publications, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myaea.org/PDFfile/Confidence+in+State+Institutions07.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070809021852/http://www.myaea.org/PDFfile/Confidence+in+State+Institutions07.pdf |archivedate=2007-08-09 |title=Confidence in State and Local Institutions Survey |work=Capital Survey Research Center |accessdate= 2007-06-02 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=David |last=White |title=Poll says we feel good about state Trust in government, unlike some institutions, hasn't fallen |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2007-06-02 |work=Birmingham News |publisher=Birmingham News |page=13A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey, 80% of Alabama respondents reported their religion as Christian (other than Catholic,) 6% as Catholic, and 11% as having no religion at all.&lt;ref name=ARIS2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://b27.cc.trincoll.edu/weblogs/AmericanReligionSurvey-ARIS/reports/ARIS_Report_2008.pdf |format=PDF |title=AMERICAN RELIGIOUS IDENTIFICATION SURVEY (ARIS) 2008 |author=Barry A.

==Economy==
&lt;!---needs to be subsectioned. Tourism, agriculture, shipping, and industry come to mind---&gt;
[[File:Alabama quarter, reverse side, 2003.jpg|thumb|Alabama's quarter depicting famous resident [[Helen Keller]] along with the longleaf pine branch and Camellia blossoms from the [[50 State Quarters]] program. Released March 19, 2003.]]

The state has heavily invested in aerospace, education, health care, and banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and [[fabrication (metal)|fabrication]].  According to the United States [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], the 2008 total [[gross state product]] was $170&amp;nbsp;billion, or $29,411 per capita. Alabama's 2008 GDP increased 0.7% from the previous year. The single largest increase came in the area of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_state/gsp_newsrelease.htm |title=GDP by State (2008) |date=June 2, 2009 |work=Bureau of Economic Analysis, Regional Economic Accounts |accessdate=2009-10-09 }} [http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_state/2009/pdf/gsp0609.pdf full release with tables]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, [[per capita income]] for the state was $18,189.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/01000.html |title=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=2007-05-30 |work=State and County Quick Facts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2010, the state's unemployment rate is 8.9%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/lau/ Bls.gov]; Local Area Unemployment Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama's [[agricultural]] outputs include [[poultry]] and [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[cattle]], plant nursery items, [[peanut]]s, [[cotton]], [[cereal|grains]] such as [[maize|corn]] and [[sorghum]], [[vegetable]]s, [[milk]], [[soybean]]s, and [[peach]]es. Although known as &quot;The Cotton State&quot;, Alabama ranks between eight and ten in national cotton production, according to various reports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://cber.cba.ua.edu/pdf/ab2005q4.pdf |title = Alabama and CBER: 75 Years of Change |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |date = Q4 2005 |work = Alabama Business |publisher = Center for Business and Economic Research, Culverhouse College of Commerce, The University of Alabama|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aces.edu/dept/nass/bulletin/2005/pg05.pdf |title = State Highlights for 2004–2005 |accessdate = 2006-09-23 |year = 2005 |work = Alabama Cooperative Extension System |publisher = USDA, NASS, Alabama Statistical Office|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Texas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Mississippi]] comprising the top three.

Alabama's [[industry|industrial]] outputs include [[iron]] and [[steel]] products (including cast-iron and steel pipe); [[paper]], [[lumber]], and [[wood]] products; [[mining]] (mostly coal); [[plastic]] products; cars and trucks; and [[apparel]]. Also, Alabama produces [[aerospace]] and [[electronics|electronic]] products, mostly in the [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]] area, location of [[NASA]] [[George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] and the [[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command|US Army Aviation and Missile Command]], headquartered at [[Redstone Arsenal]].

Alabama is part of the largest industrial growth corridor in the nation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Most of this growth is due to Alabama's rapidly expanding automotive manufacturing industry. Headquartered in the state are [[Honda Manufacturing of Alabama]], [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama]], [[Mercedes-Benz U.S. International]], and [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama]].  Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation in automobile output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/facts/2008_fotw539.html |title=Vehicle Technologies Program: Fact #539: October 6, 2008 Light Vehicle Production by State |publisher=.eere.energy.gov |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birmingham===
In the 1970s and 1980s, Birmingham's economy was transformed by the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] (UAB)'s investments in bio-technology and medical research.  [[UAB Hospital]] is a [[trauma center|Level I trauma center]], the only one in Alabama, that provides health care and breakthrough medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facs.org/trauma/verified.html |title=Verified Trauma Centers |date=December 30, 2010 |work=American College of Surgeons, Verified Trauma Centers |accessdate=2011-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  UAB is now the area's largest employer and the largest in Alabama, with a workforce of about 20,000. Other health care-services providers such as [[HealthSouth Corporation]], [[Surgical Care Affiliates]], [[Diagnostic Health Corporation]] and [[Naphcare]] are also headquartered in the city.

Birmingham is also a leading U.S. banking center and the headquarters of [[Regions Financial Corporation]], [[BBVA Compass]] and [[Superior Bancorp]]. Birmingham-based Compass Banchshares was acquired by Madrid-based [[BBVA]] in September 2007, although the headquarters of BBVA Compass remains in Birmingham. In November 2006, Regions Financial completed its merger with [[AmSouth Bancorporation]], which was also headquartered in Birmingham. [[SouthTrust Corporation]], another large bank headquartered in Birmingham, was acquired by [[Wachovia]] in 2004 for $14.3 billion. The city still has major operations for Wachovia and its now post-operating bank [[Wells Fargo]], which includes a regional headquarters, a operations center campus and a $400 million dollar data center. Nearly a dozen smaller banks are also headquartered in the Magic City, such as Superior Bancorp, [[ServisFirst]] and New South Federal Savings Bank. Birmingham also serves as the headquarters for several large investment management companies, including [[Harbert Management Corporation]].

Telecommunications provider [[AT&amp;T]], formerly [[BellSouth]], also has a major presence in Birmingham with several large offices in the metropolitan area. The company has over 6,000 employees and more than 1,200 contract employees, that work at a local data center, located in the area. Major insurance providers include [[Protective Life]], [[Infinity Property &amp; Casualty]], [[Liberty National Life Insurance Company]] and [[ProAssurance]]. [[Torchmark Corporation]] was headquartered in the city until 2006, and still maintains its largest operation in the city.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Birmingham is also a powerhouse of construction and engineering companies. This started with Rust Engineering Company, which later became Rust International  , and has grown to include [[Brasfield &amp; Gorrie]], [[BE&amp;K]], [[Hoar Construction]] and [[B.L. Harbert International]], which all routinely are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design, international construction, and engineering firms. (Rust International was acquired in 2000 by [[Washington Group International]], which was in turn acquired by San-Francisco based [[URS Corporation]] in 2007.)

===Huntsville===
Huntsville's main economic influence is derived from aerospace and military technology. [[Redstone Arsenal]], NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], [[Cummings Research Park]] (CRP), and the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] help drive the economy. Huntsville has commercial technology companies such as the network access company [[ADTRAN]], computer graphics company [[Intergraph]], and design and manufacturer of IT infrastructure [[Avocent]]. Telecommunications provider [[Deltacom]] is headquartered in Huntsville. [[Cinram]] manufactures and distributes 20th Century Fox DVDs and Blu-ray Discs out of their Huntsville plant. [[Sanmina-SCI]] has a large presence in the area.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Forty-two Fortune 500 companies have operations in Huntsville.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  In 2005, Forbes Magazine named the Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area as 6th best place in the nation for doing business, and number one in terms of the number of engineers per total employment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Mobile===
The city of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama's only saltwater port, is a busy seaport on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with inland waterway access to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] by way of the [[Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway]].  The [[Port of Mobile]] is currently the 9th largest by [[tonnage]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;ports1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=WATERBORNE COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES |work=U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: Waterborne Commerce Statistics| page=90| url=http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/pdf/wcusnatl08.pdf| accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2007, a site north of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] was selected by German steelmaker [[ThyssenKrupp]] for a $3.7&amp;nbsp;billion steel production plant, with the promise of 2,700 permanent jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=''ThyssenKrupp's Alabama incentive package tops $811&amp;nbsp;million'' |publisher=Press register|date=2007-05-11 |url=http://www.al.com/newsflash/regional/index.ssf?/base/business-2/1178924126194090.xml&amp;storylist=alabamanews |accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

$9 billion is spent annually on &quot;travel related expenses.&quot; This figure is used to indicate the extent of tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=David A. |last=Fahrenthold |title=Obama to survey environmental damage in gulf |url=| work= |publisher=Washington Pose |location=Washington, DC |pages= A6 |date=2 May 2010 |id= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montgomery===
Montgomery is Alabama's capital and the second-largest city in the state; much of the city's economy is driven by government jobs. As of January 2011, the city's largest employers were [[Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base]], the [[Government of Alabama|State of Alabama]], and the [[Montgomery Public Schools]].  Manufacturing is the third-largest sector of Montgomery's economy, and one of the fastest growing.  Large manufacturing employers include [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama]], [[Rheem|Rheem Water Heaters]], [[GKN Aerospace]], and [[Hyundai Mobis|Mobis Alabama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MGM Employers&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.montgomerychamber.com/Page.aspx?pid=316 |title=Economic Base – Largest Employers |publisher=Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce |date = August 2008|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's Gross Metropolitan Product is $12.15 billion, representing 8.7% of the Gross State Product of Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://usmayors.org/metroeconomies/Top100_2006.pdf |title=The Role of Metro Areas in the U.S. economy |publisher=U.S. Conference of Mayors |date=March 1, 2006 |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxes==
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent personal income tax, depending upon the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are not allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, but can deduct federal Social Security and Medicare taxes.

The state's general sales tax rate is 4%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070520231150/http://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/sl_sales.html Comparison of State and Local Retail Sales Taxes], July 2004 Retrieved on May 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection rate could be substantially higher, depending upon additional city and county sales taxes. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay a 11% tax on a meal. Sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide. Alabama is also one of the few remaining states that levies a tax on food and medicine. Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the nation's very highest.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbpp.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=1812 |title=Reducing Alabama's Income Tax on Working-Poor Families: Two Options - 4/14/99 |publisher=Cbpp.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbpp.org&quot;/&gt; Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbpp.org&quot;/&gt;

The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taxfoundation.org/files/sl_burden_alabama-2007-04-04.pdf |title=Alabama State Local Tax Burden Compared to U.S. Average (1970–2007) |accessdate=2007-05-30 |format=PDF |work=Tax Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Property tax]]es are the lowest in the United States. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.

Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670&amp;nbsp;million.

==Transportation==
Alabama has five major interstate roads that cross it: [[I-65]] runs north–south roughly through the middle of the state; I-59/I-20 travels from the central west border to Birmingham, where [[I-59]] continues to the north-east corner of the state and [[I-20]] continues east towards Atlanta; [[I-85]] originates in Montgomery and runs east-northeast to the Georgia border, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] traverses the southernmost portion of the state, running from west to east through Mobile. Another interstate road, [[I-22]], is currently under construction. When completed around 2012 it will connect Birmingham with [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  Several U.S.Highways also pass through the state, such as [[U.S. Route 11|US 11]], [[U.S. Route 29|US 29]], [[U.S. Route 31|US 31]], [[U.S. Route 43|US 43]], [[U.S. Route 72|US 72]], [[U.S. Route 78|US 78]], [[U.S. Route 80|US 80]], [[U.S. Route 82|US 82]], [[U.S. Route 84|US 84]], [[U.S. Route 98|US 98]], [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]], [[U.S. Route 278|US 278]], [[U.S. Route 280|US 280]], and [[U.S. Route 431|US 431]].

Major airports in Alabama include [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport]] (BHM), [[Huntsville International Airport]] (HSV), [[Dothan Regional Airport]] (DHN), [[Mobile Regional Airport]] (MOB), [[Montgomery Regional Airport]] (MGM), [[Northwest Alabama Regional Airport|Muscle Shoals – Northwest Alabama Regional Airport]] (MSL), [[Tuscaloosa Regional Airport]] (TCL), and [[Pryor Field Regional Airport]] (DCU). For rail transport, [[Amtrak]] schedules the Crescent, a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with stops at Anniston, Birmingham, and Tuscaloosa.

==Law and government==
[[File:Alabama state capitol, Montgomery.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama State Capitol|State Capitol]], built in 1850]]

===State government===
{{Main|Government of Alabama}}

The foundational document for Alabama's government is the [[Alabama Constitution]], which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the [[U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post&quot;&gt;{{Cite news
|last = Roig-Franzia |first = Manuel |title = Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds |publisher = Washington Post |date = 2004-11-28 |url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A16443-2004Nov27?language=printer |accessdate = 2006-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Constitution of Alabama - 1901 |work = The Alabama Legislative Information System |url = http://www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/1901/Constitution1901_toc.htm |accessdate = 2006-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitutionalreform.org/ |title=Alabama Citizens for Constitutional Reform |publisher=Constitutionalreform.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement is based upon the fact that Alabama's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands. Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length were intentional to codify segregation and racism.

Alabama is divided into three equal branches:
The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation.

The [[executive branch]] is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the [[Governor of Alabama]]. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], the [[Alabama Secretary of State]], the [[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]], the [[Alabama State Treasurer]], and the [[State Auditor of Alabama]].

The [[judicial branch]] is responsible for interpreting the [[Alabama Constitution|Constitution]] and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The highest court is the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]].

===Local and county government===
{{Alabama County Labelled Map|align=right|width=310}}

Alabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the County Commission, which usually also has executive authority in the county. Because of the restraints placed in the [[Alabama Constitution]], all but seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.

Alabama is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]]; the government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. However, counties can declare themselves &quot;dry&quot;; the state does not sell alcohol in those areas.

===State politics===
[[File:Dr. Robert Bentley.png|thumb|Alabama Governor Robert Bentley]]

The current [[Governor of Alabama|governor]] of the state is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Robert J. Bentley|Robert Bentley]]. The [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|lieutenant governor]] is [[Kay Ivey]]. The Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Democrat [[Sue Bell Cobb]]. The [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] currently holds a large majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial [[veto]] by a mere simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the [[Third Military District]] under [[John Pope (military officer)|General John Pope]]. In 1874, the political coalition known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African American vote.

After 1890, a coalition of whites passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise black residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor whites, however. By 1941 more whites than blacks had been disfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000, although the impact was greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised.

From 1901 to the 1960s, the state legislature failed to perform redistricting as population grew and shifted within the state. The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972.

With the disfranchisement of African Americans, the state became part of the &quot;[[Solid South]]&quot;, a one-party system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] became essentially the only political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100&amp;nbsp;years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election.

In the 1986 Democratic primary election, the then-incumbent Lieutenant Governor, [[Bill Baxley]], lost the Democratic nomination for Governor in a scandal{{Citation needed|reason=In northeastern and other states, it is legal (if stupid) to cross party lines to vote|date=February 2010}} to then Attorney General [[Charles Graddick]]. The state Democratic party invalidated the election and placed Baxley's name on the ballot as the Democratic candidate instead of the candidate chosen in the primary. The voters of the state revolted at what they perceived as disenfranchisement of their right to vote and elected the Republican challenger [[Guy Hunt]] as Governor. He was the first Republican Governor elected in Alabama since Reconstruction. Since then, Republicans have become increasingly competitive in Alabama politics. They currently control [[111th United States Congress|both seats]] in the U.S. Senate, six out of the state's [[112th United States Congress|seven congressional seats]].  Republicans hold an 8–1 majority on the [[Alabama Supreme Court]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor - Breaking News from The Birmingham News - al.com |publisher=Blog.al.com |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hold all of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices.

However, Democrats currently hold one of the three seats on the Alabama Public Service Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title= Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=2008-11-05 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep | al.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of local offices in the state are still held by Democrats. Local elections in rural counties are generally decided in the Democratic primary and local elections in metropolitan counties are decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=1 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Democratic Primary Election Results - Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=2006&amp;f=0&amp;off=5&amp;elect=2 |title=2006 Gubernatorial Republican Primary Election Results - Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date=2007-02-15 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two Republican Lt. Governors have been elected since Reconstruction, [[Steve Windom]] and Kay Ivey [[Kay Ivey]], the current Lt. Governor. Windom served as [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alabama|Lt. Governor]] under Democratic Gov. [[Don Siegelman]].  Before 2011, the last time that Alabama had a governor and Lt. governor of the same party was the period between 1983 and 1987 when Wallace was serving his fourth term as governor and [[Bill Baxley]] was serving as Lt. Governor; both were Democrats.

An overwhelming majority of sheriff's offices in Alabama are in [[Democratic]] hands. However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over more rural and less populated counties and the majority of Republicans preside over more urban/suburban and more populated counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/?PageID=131&amp;IsNav=true |title=Association |publisher=Alabama Sheriffs |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two Alabama counties (Montgomery and Calhoun) with a population of over 100,000 have Democratic sheriffs and five [[Counties of Alabama|Alabama counties]] with a population of under 75,000 have Republican sheriffs (Autauga, Coffee, Dale, Coosa, and Blount).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alabamasheriffs.com/Image.aspx?ImageID=11481&amp;Title=2007-2011+Alabama+Sheriffs |title=2007-2011 Alabama Sheriffs |publisher=Alabamasheriffs.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], when majority whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. [[George Wallace]], the state's governor, remains a notorious and controversial figure. Only with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964&lt;ref name=&quot;cra64&quot;/&gt; and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain suffrage and other civil rights.

In 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and the Governor signed, a resolution expressing &quot;profound regret&quot; over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=2007-06-01 |accessdate=2007-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alabama, the members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections, but the statewide officials, such as the Governor, Lt. Governor, Attorney General, and other constitutional offices take office in the following January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislature.state.al.us/misc/legislativeprocess/legislativeprocess_ml.html|title = Alabama's Legislative Process |first = McDowell |last= Lee|year = 2009|publisher = State of Alabama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1876 through 1956, Alabama supported only Democratic presidential candidates, by large margins. In 1960, the Democrats won with [[John F. Kennedy]] on the ballot, but the Democratic electors from Alabama gave 6 of their 11 electoral votes as a protest to [[Harry F. Byrd|Harry Byrd]]. In [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], Republican [[Barry Goldwater]] carried the state, in part because of his opposition to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which restored the franchise for African Americans.

In [[United States presidential election, 1968|the 1968 presidential election]], Alabama supported native son and [[American Independent Party]] candidate [[George Wallace]] over both [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Wallace was the official [[Democratic]] candidate in Alabama, while Humphrey was listed as the &quot;National Democratic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=1&amp;year=1968&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0 |title=1968 Presidential General Election Results - Alabama |publisher=Uselectionatlas.org |date=1968-11-05 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], Democratic candidate [[Jimmy Carter]] from Georgia carried the state, the region, and the nation, but Democratic control of the region slipped after that.

Since 1980, conservative Alabama voters have increasingly voted for Republican candidates at the Federal level, especially in Presidential elections. By contrast, Democratic candidates have been elected to many state-level offices and until 2010 comprised a longstanding majority in the [[Alabama Legislature]]; see [[Dixiecrat]].

In [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], [[George W. Bush]] won Alabama's nine electoral votes by a margin of 25 percentage points with 62.5% of the vote, mostly white voters. The 11 counties that voted Democratic were [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]] counties, where [[African American]]s are the majority racial group.

The state's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are [[Jeff Sessions|Jefferson B. Sessions III]] and [[Richard Shelby|Richard C. Shelby]], both Republicans.

In the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: ([[Jo Bonner]], [[Mike D. Rogers]], [[Robert Aderholt]], [[Morris J. Brooks]], [[Martha Roby]], and [[Spencer Bachus]]) and one Democrat: [[Terri Sewell]]).

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Alabama}}

===Primary and secondary education===

Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the overview of the [[Alabama State Board of Education]] as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,541 individual schools provide education for 743,364 elementary and secondary students.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.alsde.edu/general/quick_facts.pdf |title = Alabama Education Quick Facts 2007 |accessdate = 2007-08-11 |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year.&lt;ref name=&quot;qfacts&quot;/&gt; In 2007, over 82&amp;nbsp;percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National [[No Child Left Behind]] law, using measures determined by the State of Alabama. In 2004, 23 percent of schools met AYP.&lt;ref name=&quot;AYP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.alsde.edu/Accountability/2007Reports/Press/2007AYPNewsRelease.pdf |title = Eighty-Two Percent of Alabama Schools Make AYP While Increasing Annual Measurable Objectives |accessdate = 2007-08-11 |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Alabama's public education system has improved,&lt;!---since when? without date this means nothing. Also this para chronicles NO improvement---&gt; it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data, Alabama's high school graduation rate – 75% – is the second lowest in the United States (after Mississippi).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-24.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusscope.org/us/s1/chart_education.html Education Statistics].

Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are two medical schools ([[University of Alabama at Birmingham]] and [[University of South Alabama]]), two veterinary colleges ([[Auburn University]] and [[Tuskegee University]]), a dental school ([[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]), an optometry college ([[University of Alabama at Birmingham]]), two pharmacy schools ([[Auburn University]] and [[Samford University]]), and five law schools ([[University of Alabama School of Law]], [[Birmingham School of Law]], [[Cumberland School of Law]], [[Miles Law School]], and the [[Thomas Goode Jones School of Law]]).  Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to 16 doctoral level programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ache&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work= Alabama Commission on Higher Education |title= Degree titles and abbreviations |url= http://www.ache.state.al.us/Acadaffr/ProInv/Degreeabbr.htm |accessdate= 2007-09-03}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accreditation of academic programs is through the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges as well as a plethora of subject focused national and international accreditation agencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ache2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Alabama Commission on Higher Education |title=Accreditation |url=http://www.ache.state.al.us/Colleges&amp;Universities/Accreditation/index.htm |accessdate= 2007-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Leon Benouville The Wrath of Achilles.jpg|thumb|''The Wrath of Achilles'', by [[François-Léon Benouville]] (1821–1859) ([[Musée Fabre]])]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Achilles''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{polytonic|Ἀχιλλεύς}}, ''Achilleus'') was a [[Greeks|Greek]] hero of the [[Trojan War]], the central character and the greatest warrior of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''.

Achilles was the most handsome of the heroes assembled against [[Troy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', [[Symposium (Plato)#Phaedrus|180a]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later legends (beginning with a poem by [[Statius]] in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. As he died because of a small wound on his heel, the term &quot;[[Achilles' heel]]&quot; has come to mean a person's principal weakness.

==Birth==
Achilles was the son of the [[nymph]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], the king of the [[Myrmidons]]. [[Zeus]] and [[Poseidon]] had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until [[Prometheus]], the fire-bringer, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed  Peleus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]], ''Prometheus Bound'' 755–768; [[Pindar]], ''Nemean'' 5.34–37, ''Isthmian'' 8.26–47; ''[[Poeticon astronomicon]]'' (ii.15)&lt;/ref&gt;

As with most mythology there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in ''[[Argonautica]]'' (iv.760) [[Hera]] alludes to Thetis's chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected him. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.&lt;!--the following psychological interpretation has no counterpart in the myths:&quot;Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal. So Hera recommended that she marry [[Peleus]], as he was as near to a mortal as she was ever going to get.&quot;--&gt; 
[[Image:The Education of Achilles, by James Barry.jpg|thumb|''The Education of Achilles'' (ca.&amp;nbsp;1772), by [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]]]]
According to the ''[[Achilleid]]'', written by Statius in the 1st century AD, and to no surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river [[Styx]]. However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him, his heel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Death and Afterlife of Achilles |last=Burgess |first=Jonathan S. |year=2009 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-8018-9029-2 |page=9 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=YVnS1IcVWuYC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Achilleid+dipped+Styx&amp;cd=53#v=onepage&amp;q= |accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Achilles heel]], [[Achilles' tendon]]). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in [[ambrosia]] and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''[[Argonautica]]'' 4.869–879.&lt;/ref&gt;

However none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability.  To the contrary, in the ''Iliad'' Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the [[Paeonian]] hero [[Asteropaeus]], son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, &quot;drawing a spurt of blood&quot;.

Also in the fragmentary poems of the [[Epic Cycle]] in which we can find description of the hero's death, [[Cypria|Kúpria]] (unknown author), ''[[Aithiopis]]'' by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], ''[[Little Iliad|Ilias Mikrá]]'' by Lesche of Mytilene, Iliou pérsis by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness (heel); in the later vase paintings presenting Achilles' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body.

Peleus entrusted Achilles to [[Chiron]] the [[Centaur]], on Mt. [[Pelion]], to be raised.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Catalogue of Women'', fr. 204.87–89 MW; ''Iliad'' 11.830-32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achilles in the Trojan War==
[[Image:The Rage of Achilles by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo.jpeg|thumb|''The Rage of Achilles'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]]]

The first two lines of the ''Iliad'' read:
:{{Polytonic|μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος}}
:{{Polytonic|οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί' Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε' ἔθηκεν,}}

:Sing, Goddess, of the rage, of Peleus' son Achilles
:the accursed rage, which brought pain to thousands of the [[Achaean]]s.

Achilles' consuming rage is at some times wavering, but at other times he cannot be cooled. The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative.

According to the Iliad (Book 16), Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 Myrmidons. Achilles appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons) who were: Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon.

===Telephus===
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in [[Mysia]], ruled by King [[Telephus]]. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;. Guided by the oracle, he arrived at [[Argos]], where Achilles heals him in order that he become their guide for the voyage to Troy.
		
According to other reports in [[Euripides]]' lost play about Telephus, he went to [[Aulis]] pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]] for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. [[Odysseus]] reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.

===Troilus===
According to the [[Cypria]] (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' Wrath), when the Achaeans desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas, sacked neighboring cities and killed [[Troilus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stoa.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Stoa:text:2003.01.0004 |title=Proclus' Summary of the Cypria |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dares Phrygius]]' ''Account of the Destruction of Troy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/DaresTW.html |title=Dares' account of the destruction of Troy, Greek Mythology Link |publisher=Homepage.mac.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, [[Troilus]] was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King [[Priam]]'s (or sometimes [[Apollo]]) and [[Hecuba]]'s five legitimate sons. Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders. Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister [[Polyxena]], and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth&amp;nbsp;– who refusing to yield found instead himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo.  Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace. In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege.&lt;ref&gt;James Davidson, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v29/n14/davi02_.html &quot;Zeus Be Nice Now&quot;] in ''London Review of Books;'' 19 July 2007, accessed October 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the [[First Vatican Mythographer]] claimed Troy would have been invincible.

===In the ''Iliad''===

[[Image:AmbrosianIliadPict47Achilles.jpg|thumb|Achilles sacrificing to [[Zeus]], from the [[Ambrosian Iliad]], a 5th-century illuminated manuscript]]
{{main|Iliad}}

Homer's ''Iliad'' is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by [[Agamemnon]], the commander of the [[Achaean]] forces. Agamemnon had taken a woman named [[Chryseis]] as his slave. Her father [[Chryses]], a priest of [[Apollo]], begged Agamemnon to return her to him.  Agamemnon refused and Apollo sent a plague amongst the Greeks.  The prophet [[Calchas]] correctly determined the source of the troubles but would not speak unless Achilles vowed to protect him. Achilles did so and Calchas declared Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consented, but then commanded that Achilles' battle prize [[Briseis]] be brought to replace Chryseis.  Angry at the dishonor (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis)&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 9.334–343.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the urging of Thetis, Achilles refused to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At this same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles prayed to his mother Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honor.

As the battle turned against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] declared that the Trojans were winning because Agamemnon had angered Achilles, and urged the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agreed and sent [[Odysseus]] and two other chieftains, [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]] and [[Phoenix (Iliad)|Phoenix]], to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejected all Agamemnon offered him, and simply urged the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.

The Trojans, led by [[Hector]], subsequently pushed the Greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, [[Patroclus]] led the [[Myrmidons]] into battle wearing Achilles' armor, though Achilles remained at his camp. Patroclus succeeded in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but was killed by Hector before he could lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

[[Image:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in front of the Gates of [[Troy]] (from a [[panoramic]] [[fresco]] on the upper level of the main hall of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]]).]]

After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from [[Antilochus]], the son of Nestor, Achilles grieved over his cousin's death and held many funeral games in his honor.  His mother Thetis came to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuaded [[Hephaestus]] to make a new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector. The new armor included the [[Shield of Achilles]], described in great detail by the poet.

Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ended his refusal to fight and took the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector.  Achilles even engaged in battle with the river god [[Scamander]] who became angry that Achilles was choking his waters with all the men he killed.  The god tried to drown Achilles but was stopped by [[Hera]] and Hephaestus.  Zeus himself took note of Achilles' rage and sent the gods to restrain him so that he would not go on to sack Troy itself, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles could defy fate itself as Troy was not meant to be destroyed yet.  Finally Achilles found his prey. Achilles chased Hector around the wall of Troy three times before [[Athena]], in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, [[Deiphobus]], persuaded Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realized the trick, he knew the battle was inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charged at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but missed. Accepting his fate, Hector begged Achilles&amp;nbsp;–not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles told Hector it was hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that &quot;my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw&amp;nbsp;– such agonies you have caused me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Iliad&quot;, Fagles translation. Penguin Books, 1991, p. 553.&lt;/ref&gt; Achilles then got his vengeance, killing Hector with a single blow to the neck and tying the Trojan's body to his [[chariot]], dragging it around the battlefield for twelve days.

With the assistance of the god [[Hermes]], Hector's father, [[Priam]], went to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles to permit him to perform for Hector his funeral rites.  The final passage in the ''Iliad'' is Hector's funeral, after which the doom of Troy was just a matter of time.

===Penthesilea===
Achilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazonian]] warrior queen [[Penthesilea]], but later grieved over her death. At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her. As he grieved over the death of such a rare beauty, a notorious Greek jeerer by the name of Thersites laughed and mocked the great Achilles. Annoyed by his insensitivity and disrespect, Achilles punched him in the face and killed him instantly.

=== Memnon, and the fall of Achilles ===
[[Image:Achilles thniskon in Corfu.jpg|thumb|Achilles dying in the gardens of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] in [[Corfu]]]]

Following the death of Patroclus, Achilles' closest companion was Nestor's son [[Antilochus]].  When [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], king of [[Ethiopia (mythology)|Ethiopia]] killed Antilochus, Achilles was once again drawn onto the battlefield to seek revenge. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the ''Iliad'''s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the [[Epic Cycle|cyclic epic]] ''[[Aethiopis]]'', which was composed after the ''Iliad'', possibly in the 7th century B.C. The ''Aethiopis'' is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.

{{anchor|Fatalwound}}As predicted by [[Hector]] with his dying breath, Achilles was thereafter killed by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god [[Apollo]] guided Paris' arrow.  Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow.

[[Image:Aias body Akhilleus Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1884.jpg|thumb|Ajax carries off the body of Achilles: [[Attica|Attic]] black-figure ''[[lekythos]]'', ca. 510 BC, from Sicily ([[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich)]] Both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valor owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of [[Patroclus]], and funeral games were held. He was represented  in the lost Trojan War epic of [[Arctinus of Miletus]] as living after his death in the island of [[Leuke]] at the mouth of the river [[Danube]] (see below).  Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, [[Polyxena]]. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage.  Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior.  But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.

Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton E. Mythology, New York: Penguin Books; 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris was later killed by [[Philoctetes]] using the enormous bow of [[Heracles]].

===Fate of Achilles' armor===
Achilles' armor was the object of a feud between [[Odysseus]] and [[Ajax (mythology)|Telamonian Ajax]] (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of Odysseus. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned the ire of Athena.  Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades.  After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, he was so embarrassed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armor to [[Neoptolemus]], the son of Achilles.

A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of [[Phaselis]], Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by [[Alexander the Great]], who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the ''Iliad'' with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear, which he would indeed have touched with excitement.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexander came to rest at Phaselis, a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of Achilles' original spear.&quot; (Robin Lane Fox, ''Alexander the Great''1973.144.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was being shown in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias,  iii.3.6; see Christian Jacob and Anne Mullen-Hohl, &quot;The Greek Traveler's Areas of Knowledge: Myths and Other Discourses in Pausanias' Description of Greece&quot;, ''Yale French Studies'' '''59''': Rethinking History: Time, Myth, and Writing (1980:65–85) esp. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achilles' relationship with Patroclus is a key aspect of his myth.  Its exact nature has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times.  In the ''Iliad'', it appears to be generally portrayed as a model of deep and loyal friendship, but commentators from the classical period to today have tended to interpret the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. Thus in 5th-century BC Athens the relationship was commonly interpreted as [[pederastic]]. Contemporary readers may interpret the two heroes either as relatives or close friends, as &quot;war buddies&quot;, as being in a teacher/student  relationship, or in love with each other as an egalitarian [[homosexuality|homosexual]] couple. Whichever the case may be, Achilles nevertheless continued to have sexual relationships with women.

==Cult of Achilles in antiquity==
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Briseis and Achilles.jpg|thumb|right|Achilles and Briseis]]

There was an archaic [[heroic cult]] of Achilles on the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|White Island, ''Leuce'']], in the [[Black Sea]] off the modern coasts of [[Romania]] and [[Ukraine]], with a temple and an [[oracle]] which survived into the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Hedreen, &quot;The Cult of Achilles in the Euxine&quot; ''Hesperia'' '''60'''.3 (July 1991), pp. 313–330.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lost epic ''[[Aithiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad'' attributed to [[Arctinus|Arktinus of Miletos]],  Achilles’ mother Thetis returned to mourn  him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube. There the Achaeans raised a [[tumulus]] for him and celebrated funeral games.

[[Pliny's Natural History]] (IV.27.1) mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident (''Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara''), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from [[Peuce]] by the [[Danube Delta]], and the temple there. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] has been told that the island is &quot;covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles’ temple and his statue&quot; (III.19.11). Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island.

[[Pomponius Mela]] tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister (''De situ orbis'', II, 7). The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called ''Leuce'' &quot;because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor&quot; (''Orbis descriptio'', v. 541, quoted in Densuşianu 1913).

The ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini|Periplus of the Euxine Sea]]'' gives the following details: &quot;It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus’ honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles’ temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles’ honor. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles’ oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn’t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships&quot;. (quoted in Densuşianu)

The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the [[Black Sea|Pontic Sea]] but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.

Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as ''Pontarches'' the lord and master of the Pontic Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation. Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice. To Achilles of Leuce  were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia ([[Stephanus Byzantinus]]), Achilleios in Laconia ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], III.25,4) [[Nicolae Densuşianu]] (Densuşianu 1913) even though he recognized Achilles in the name of [[Aquileia]] and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia (&quot;Achileii&quot;), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.&quot;

Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the [[Delphi|Delphic Pythia]] sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound.  [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters (''aquae'') on the island.

===Cult of Achilles in modern times: The Achilleion in Corfu===
In the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι) to the south of the city of [[Corfu]] Greece, Empress of Austria [[Elisabeth of Bavaria]] also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to [[platonism|platonic]] [[romanticism]]. The palace, naturally, was named after Achilles: ''[[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]]'' (Αχίλλειον). This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the [[Trojan war]].

==The name of Achilles==
Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of {{Polytonic|ἄχος}} (''akhos'') &quot;grief&quot; and {{Polytonic|λαός}} (''Laos'') &quot;a people, tribe, nation, etc.&quot; In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the ''Iliad'' (frequently by Achilles). Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of ''kleos'' (glory, usually glory in war).

''Laos'' has been construed by [[Gregory Nagy]], following Leonard Palmer, to mean ''a corps of soldiers'', a [[muster (military)|muster]]. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/search?patt=*AXIL&amp;first=250 Epigraphical database] gives 476 matches for Ἀχιλ-.The earliest ones: [http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=27810&amp;bookid=6&amp;region=2&amp;subregion=1 Corinth 7th c. BC],[http://epigraphy.packhum.org/inscriptions/oi?ikey=238250&amp;bookid=118&amp;region=3&amp;subregion=7 Delphi 530 BC], Attica and Elis 5th c. BC.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία, ''Achilleía'', attested in Attica in the 4th century BC ([[Inscriptiones Graecae|IG]] II² 1617), and, in the form  ''Achillia'', on a [[Female gladiator#Halicarnassus|stele in Halicarnassus]] as the name of a female gladiator fighting an &quot;Amazon&quot;.  Roman gladiatorial games often referenced classical mythology, and this seems to reference Achilles' fight with Penthesilea but gives it an extra twist of Achilles' being &quot;played&quot; by a woman.

==Other stories==
[[Image:Achilles in Corfu.JPG|thumb|left|Achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens of the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] in Corfu. He gazes northward toward the city. The inscription in Greek reads: ΑΧΙΛΛΕΥΣ i.e. Achilles]]
Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]].  There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name &quot;Pyrrha&quot; (the red-haired girl).  With Lycomedes' daughter [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidamia]], whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, [[Neoptolemus]] (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias).  According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet [[Calchas]] that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid.  Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods.  When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign.  In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus III|Philostratus Junior]], ''Imagines'' i; Scholiast on Homer's Iliad, xix. 326; [[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'' 13.162ff., [[Apollodorus]] iii. 13. 8, [[Statius]], [[Achilleid]], ii. 167ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In book 11 of Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction.  This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the [[Greek colonies]] on the Black Sea, the location of the mythical &quot;White Island&quot; which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes.

The kings of the [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus. [[Alexander the Great]], son of the Epirote princess [[Olympias]], could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at [[Achilleion (Troad)#Tomb of Achilles|Achilleion]] while passing Troy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' 1.12.1, [[Cicero]], ''Pro Archia Poeta'' 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In AD [[216]] the Roman Emperor [[Caracalla]], while on his way to war against [[Parthia]], emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]] 78.16.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Achilles fought and killed the [[Amazons|Amazon]] [[Helene (Amazon)|Helene]]. Some also said he married [[Medea]], and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades&amp;nbsp;– as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius' [[Argonautica]]. In some versions of the myth, Achilles has a relationship with his captive [[Briseis]].

==In Greek tragedy==
{{main|Achilles (play)}}
The [[tragedy|Greek tragedian]] [[Aeschylus]] wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title ''Achilleis'' by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of [[Hector]] and eventual death when an arrow shot by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and guided by [[Apollo]] punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the ''Achilleis'' and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play.  The first part of the ''Achilleis'' trilogy, ''The Myrmidons'', focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today.&lt;ref&gt;Pantelis Michelakis, ''Achilles in Greek Tragedy'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedian [[Sophocles]] also wrote a play with Achilles as the main character, ''The Lovers of Achilles''. Only a few fragments survive.

==In Greek philosophy==
The philosopher [[Zeno of Elea]] centered one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|his paradoxes]] on an imaginary footrace between &quot;swift-footed&quot; [[Zeno's paradoxes#Achilles and the tortoise|Achilles and a tortoise]], by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.

'''Abraham Lincoln''' (February 12, 1809&amp;nbsp;– April 15, 1865) served as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|16th President of the United States]] from March 1861 until [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|his assassination]] in April 1865. He successfully led the country through its greatest constitutional, military and moral crisis&amp;mdash;the [[American Civil War]]&amp;mdash;by preserving the Union by force while ending slavery and promoting economic modernization. Reared in a poor family on the western frontier, he was mostly self-educated.  He became a [[country lawyer]], an [[Illinois]] [[Illinois House of Representatives|state legislator]], and a one-term member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] but failed in two attempts at a seat in the [[United States Senate]]. He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children.

Lincoln was an outspoken opponent of the expansion of [[slavery in the United States]], which he deftly articulated in his campaign debates and speeches.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goodwin|Goodwin]], p. 91; [[#Holzer|Holzer]], p. 232.
&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, he secured the Republican nomination and was [[United States presidential election, 1860|elected president in 1860]]. After war began, following declarations of [[Secession in the United States|secession]] by southern slave states, he concentrated on both the military and political dimensions of the war effort, seeking to reunify the nation. He vigorously exercised unprecedented war powers, including the arrest and detention without trial of thousands of suspected secessionists. He issued his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in 1863 and promoted the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], [[abolitionism|abolishing slavery]].

Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. He brought leaders of various factions of his party into his cabinet and pressured them to cooperate. He defused a confrontation with Britain in the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]] late in 1861. Under his leadership, the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] took control of the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]] at the start of the war and tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond. Each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another until finally Grant succeeded in 1865. A shrewd politician deeply involved with patronage and power issues in each state, he reached out to [[War Democrats]] and managed his own reelection in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]].

As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party, Lincoln came under attack from all sides. [[Radical Republicans]] wanted harsher treatment of the South, Democrats desired more compromise, and secessionists saw him as their enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Tagg, Larry. &quot;Evidence for the Unpopular Mr. Lincoln&quot;, ''Hallowed Ground Mag.'', Spring 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln fought back with [[patronage]], by pitting his opponents against each other, and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randall2|Randall]], pp. 65–87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holzer, Harold [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2009/6/2009_6_40.shtml &quot;Lincoln the Orator&quot;], ''American Heritage'', June 2006, Retrieved November 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, his [[Gettysburg Address]] of 1863 became one of the most quoted speeches in American history. It was an iconic statement of America's dedication to the principles of nationalism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. At the close of the war, Lincoln held a moderate view of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], seeking to speedily reunite the nation through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. Just six days after the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|decisive surrender]] of the commanding general of the [[Confederate army]], Lincoln fell victim to an assassin, the first U.S. president to suffer such a fate. Lincoln has consistently been [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents#Scholar survey results|ranked by scholars]] as one of the greatest U.S. presidents.

==Early life==
{{Main|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln}}
Abraham Lincoln (no middle name) was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Lincoln]] (née Hanks), in a one-room [[log cabin]] on the [[Sinking Spring Farm]] in southeast [[Hardin County, Kentucky|Hardin County]], [[Kentucky]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[LaRue County, Kentucky|LaRue County]]). 

Little is known about Lincoln's ancestors. Historical investigations have traced his family back to [[Samuel Lincoln]], an [[apprentice]] [[weaver]] who arrived in [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], [[Massachusetts]], from [[Norfolk]], [[England]], in 1637.&lt;ref name=&quot;pessen-1984-p24-25&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Pessen, Edward|title=The Log Cabin Myth: The Social Backgrounds of American Presidents|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1984|isbn=0-300-03166|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;donald-1996-p20&quot;&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lincoln himself was only able to trace his heritage back as far as his paternal [[grandfather]] and namesake, [[Abraham Lincoln (captain)|Abraham Lincoln]], a local [[militia]] captain and substantial landholder with an inherited {{convert|200|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[landed estate|estate]] in [[Rockingham County, Virginia]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;pessen-1984-p24-25&quot; /&gt; The elder Abraham later moved his family from Rockingham County, Virginia, to [[Jefferson County, Kentucky]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pessen-1984-p24-25&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;white-12_13&quot; /&gt; where he was ambushed and killed in an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] raid in 1786 with his children [[Mordecai Lincoln|Mordecai]], Josiah, and Thomas looking on.&lt;ref name=&quot;white-12_13&quot;&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 12, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Mordecai's marksmanship with a rifle saved Thomas from the same fate. As the eldest son, by law Mordecai inherited his father's entire estate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thomas became a respected citizen of rural Kentucky. He bought and sold several farms, including the Sinking Spring Farm. The family belonged to a [[Separate Baptists]] church, which had high moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; though Lincoln, as an adult, never joined a church.  Thomas &quot;enjoyed considerable status&quot; in Kentucky, where he sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country patrols, and guarded prisoners. By the time his son Abraham was born, Thomas owned two {{convert|600|acre|ha|adj=on}} farms, several town lots, livestock, and horses. He was among the richest men in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;pessen-1984-p24-25&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb]], p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816, the Lincoln family lost their lands because of a faulty title and made a new start in [[Perry County, Indiana|Perry County]], Indiana (now [[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]]). Lincoln later noted that this move was &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot; but mainly due to [[land title]] difficulties.&lt;ref name=&quot;sandberg-20&quot;&gt;[[#Sandburg|Sandburg]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Abe-Lincoln-Birthplace-2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A log house on display inside a larger building.|Symbolic log cabin at the [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park]]]]

When Lincoln was nine, his 34-year-old mother died of [[milk sickness]].&lt;ref name=&quot;donald-1996-p30-33&quot; /&gt; His older sister, [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah (Grigsby)]], died while giving birth at a young age.&lt;ref name=&quot;donald-1996-p20&quot; /&gt; Soon after, his father married [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah Bush Johnston]], with whom Lincoln became very close and whom he called &quot;Mother.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he became increasingly distant from his father. Lincoln regretted his father's lack of education and did not like the hard labor associated with frontier life. Still, he willingly took responsibility for all chores expected of him as a male in the household and became an adept axeman in his work building rail fences. Lincoln also agreed with the customary obligation of a son to give his father all earnings from work done outside the home until age 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;donald-1996-p30-33&quot;&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, he occasionally loaned his father money.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 28, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, fearing a milk sickness outbreak, the family settled on public land in [[Macon County, Illinois|Macon County]], Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831, when his father relocated the family to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois|Coles County]], Illinois, 22-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the [[Sangamon River]] to the village of [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem]] in [[Sangamon County, Illinois|Sangamon County]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 23–53.&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1831, hired by New Salem businessman [[Denton Offutt]] and accompanied by friends, he took goods by flatboat from New Salem to [[New Orleans]] via the Sangamon, [[Illinois River|Illinois]], and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers. After arriving in New Orleans&amp;mdash;and witnessing slavery firsthand&amp;mdash;he walked back home.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sandburg|Sandburg]], pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's formal education consisted of approximately 18 months of classes from  several itinerant teachers; he was mostly self-educated and was an avid reader.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 38–43.&lt;/ref&gt; He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match to which he was challenged by the renowned leader of a group of ruffians, &quot;the Clary's Grove boys.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; His family and neighbors considered him to be lazy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], pp. 25, 31, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln avoided hunting and fishing out of an aversion to killing animals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sandburg|Sandburg]], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==

[[File:Mary Todd Lincoln 1846-1847 restored cropped.png|thumb|upright|alt=Black and white photo of Mary Todd Lincoln's shoulders and head|[[Mary Todd Lincoln]], wife of Abraham Lincoln, age 28]]

Lincoln's first romantic interest was [[Ann Rutledge]], whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. Ann wanted to notify a former love before &quot;consummating the engagement to Mr. L. with marriage.&quot; Rutledge died, however, on August 25, most likely of [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 55–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister. Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter from his law practice in Springfield, suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship was over.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 67–69; [[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 56–57, 69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lamb|Lamb]], p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; They met in Springfield in December 1839&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[#Sandburg|Sandburg]], pp. 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt; and were engaged sometime in late December.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;
A wedding was set for January 1, 1841, but the couple split as the wedding approached.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; They later met at a party and then married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sandburg|Sandburg]], pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;
While preparing for the nuptials and having cold feet again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, &quot;To hell, I suppose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A&amp;TLincoln.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A seated Lincoln holding a book as his young son looks at it| [[Mathew Brady]] photo (1864) depicts President Lincoln reading a book with his youngest son, [[Tad Lincoln|Tad]].]]
In 1844, the couple bought a house in Springfield near Lincoln's law office.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Todd Lincoln worked diligently in their home, assuming household duties which had been performed for her in her own family. She also made efficient use of the limited funds available from her husband's law practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; One evening, Mary asked Lincoln four times to restart the fire and, getting no reaction as he was absorbed in his reading, she grabbed a piece of firewood and rapped him on the head.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lincolns had a budding family with the birth of [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] in 1843 and [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] in 1846. According to a house girl, Abraham &quot;was remarkably fond of children,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;
and the Lincolns were not thought to be strict with their children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baker|Baker]], p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert was the only child of the Lincolns to live past the age of 18. Edward Lincoln died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, likely of tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lincolns' grief over this loss was somewhat assuaged by the birth of [[William Wallace Lincoln|William &quot;Willie&quot; Wallace Lincoln]] nearly 11 months later, on December 21. However, Willie died of a fever at the age of 11 on February 20, 1862, in [[Washington, D.C.]], during President Lincoln's first term.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], pp. 181, 476.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lincolns' fourth son, [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln]], was born on April 4, 1853, and outlived his father but died at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871, in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert Lincoln committed her to a mental health asylum in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, Jason [http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20060601-mary-todd-lincoln-abraham-lincoln-robert-todd-lincoln-batavia-illinois-sanitarium-james-bradwell-marriage.shtml &quot;The Madness of Mary Lincoln&quot;], ''American Heritage'', July 2006, Retrieved September 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham Lincoln suffered from &quot;[[melancholy]]&quot;, a condition which now may be referred to as [[clinical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Joshua [http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200510/lincolns-clinical-depression &quot;Lincoln's Great Depression&quot;], ''The Atlantic'', October 2005, Retrieved October 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's father-in-law was based in Lexington, Kentucky; he and most of the Todd family were slave owners and some members were slave traders. Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington. Lincoln's connections in Lexington could have accelerated his ambitions, but he remained in Illinois, where, to his liking, slavery was almost nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Foner|Foner (1995)]], pp. 440–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career and military service==
{{Main|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War}}
[[File:Abe Lincoln young.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Thin man looking to the right wearing a bow tie.|Sketch of young Abraham Lincoln]]
In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln bought a small general store in New Salem, Illinois. He purchased it on credit along with a partner. Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share of the business. When his partner later died, Lincoln became liable for a $1,000 debt. Unable to pay, he was forced to declare bankruptcy and did not finish repaying his creditors for another 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/14/weekinreview/june-7-13-abraham-lincoln-deadbeat.html | work=The New York Times | first=Katharine Q. | last=Seelye | title=JUNE 7–13; Abraham Lincoln, Deadbeat | date=June 14, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
That same year he began his political career with a campaign for the [[Illinois General Assembly]]. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural raconteur in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money. He advocated navigational improvements on the [[Beardstown and Sangamon Canal|Sangamon River]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|editor=Marion Mills Miller|title=Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Life_and_Works_of_Abraham_Lincoln/Volume_3/The_Improvement_of_Sangamon_River|volume=3|year=1907|publisher=Current Literature|location=New York|pages=1–8|chapter=The Improvement of Sangamon River}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the election, he served briefly as a captain in the Illinois militia during the [[Black Hawk War]], although he never saw combat. Lincoln returned from the militia and was able to campaign for the August 6 election. At {{convert|6|ft|4|in|m|2|abbr=off}}, he was tall and &quot;strong enough to intimidate any rival.&quot; At his first speech, he grabbed an antagonist by his &quot;neck and the seat of his trousers&quot; and threw him. Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he got 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 43–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and, after more dedicated self-study, as county surveyor.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834, he won election to the state legislature after a bipartisan campaign, though he ran as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading Blackstone's ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' and other law books. Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: &quot;I studied with nobody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Admission to the bar in the United States|Admitted to the bar]] in 1837, he moved to Springfield, Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln|Lincoln (1992)]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
and began to practice law under [[John T. Stuart]], Mary Todd's cousin.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], pp. 71, 79, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. In 1841, he partnered with Stephen Logan until 1844, when he began his practice with [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], whom Lincoln thought &quot;a studious young man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 67–69, 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; He served four successive terms in the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] as a Whig representative from Sangamon County.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 67–69, 75, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1835–1836 legislative session, he voted to continue the restriction on suffrage to white males only while removing the condition of land ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Simon|Simon]], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his &quot;free soil&quot; stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism. He first articulated this in 1837, saying, &quot;Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; He closely followed Henry Clay in supporting the [[American Colonization Society]] program of making the abolition of slavery practical by helping the freed slaves return to [[Liberia]] in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Foner|Foner (2010)]], pp. 17–19, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early national politics==
[[File:Abelincoln1846.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Middle aged clean shaven Lincoln from the hips up.|Lincoln in 1846 or 1847]]

From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861, &quot;I have always been an old-line [[Henry Clay]] Whig.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Guelzo|Guelzo]], p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The party favored economic modernization in banking, railroads, and internal improvements and espoused urbanization as well as protective tariffs, and Lincoln supported these positions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, Lincoln was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served one two-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oates|Oates]], p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln developed a plan to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners and a popular vote on the matter, but he dropped it when he could not get enough Whig supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harris|Harris]] p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; He used his office to speak out against the [[Mexican–American War]], which he attributed to [[James K. Polk|President Polk]]'s desire for &quot;military glory&amp;mdash;that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidler|Heidler (2006)]], pp. 181–183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln articulated his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his [[Spot Resolutions]]. The war had begun with a violent confrontation on territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S., but Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had &quot;invaded ''our territory'' and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our ''own soil''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oates|Oates]], pp. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Basler1pp199—202&quot;&gt;[[#Basler1|Basler (ed.) (2001)]], pp. 199–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Basler1pp199—202&quot;/&gt; Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, the national papers ignored it, and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him &quot;spotty Lincoln.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGovern, p. 33&quot;&gt;[[#McGovern|McGovern]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Basler1|Basler (ed.) (2001)]], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Jean; Schamel, Wynell B. [http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/lincoln-resolutions &quot;Teaching With Documents: Lincoln's Spot Resolutions&quot;], ''National Archives'', October 1988, Retrieved September 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln endorsed war hero General [[Zachary Taylor]] for the Whig nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln later came to regret some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]] p. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor won and Lincoln wanted to be Commissioner of the General Land Office, but that lucrative patronage job went to a rival in Illinois. The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the [[Oregon Territory]]. Since the territory was a Democratic stronghold, acceptance would have ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harris|Harris]] pp. 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prairie lawyer==
[[File:Young Lincoln By Charles Keck.JPG|thumb|left|&quot;Young Lincoln&quot; statue in Senn Park [[Chicago]]]]
Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield, handling &quot;every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Billings and Frank J. Williams, eds. ''Abraham Lincoln, Esq.: The Legal Career of America's Greatest President'' (University Press of Kentucky; 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Twice a year for 16 years, he &quot;rode the circuit&quot; for 10 weeks at a time, appearing in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 105–106, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river [[barge]]s under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests but ultimately represented whoever hired him. His reputation grew, and he appeared before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], arguing a case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 142–143, 156, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, he received a [[patent]] for a &quot;device to buoy vessels over shoals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&amp;objkey=19 &quot;Abraham Lincoln's Patent Model: Improvement for Buoying Vessels Over Shoals&quot;], ''Smithsonian Institution'', Retrieved June 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, he represented [[Alton Railroad|Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad]] in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A. Barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald p. 155&quot;&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dirck|Dirck]], p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter in existence at the time of Barret's pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret's payment. The decision by the [[Supreme Court of Illinois|Illinois Supreme Court]] has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald p. 155&quot;/&gt; Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Handy|Handy]], p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1853 to 1860, Lincoln was a lawyer and lobbyist for the Illinois Central Railroad, one of the largest corporations in the world at that time.&lt;ref&gt;DiLorenzo, Thomas J. [http://www.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo53.html &quot;Why the Republican Party Elected Lincoln&quot;], Lew Rockwell, October 1, 2003, Retrieved November 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended [[William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by [[judicial notice]] in order to challenge an eyewitness's credibility. After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a [[Farmers' Almanac]] showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Based on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom. In 1859, however, in another celebrated case, in which he defended Peachy Harrison, who was accused of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Unbeknown to Lincoln, this client was a cousin through Lincoln's father.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harrison1935|Harrison (1935)]], pp. 269, 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Republican politics 1854–1860==
Lincoln returned to politics in opposition to the pro-slavery [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] (1854), which repealed the slavery-restricting [[Missouri Compromise]] (1820). Senior Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of Illinois incorporated [[popular sovereignty]] into the Act and thus mandated that the people have the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in their territory rather than have such a decision imposed on them by the national Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McGovern|McGovern]], pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Alexander Helser, 1860-crop.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lincoln in 1860|alt=Head shot of older, clean shaven Lincoln]]
On October 16, 1854, in his &quot;[[Abraham Lincoln Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]],&quot; Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 148–152.&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice,&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; he said the Kansas Act had a &quot;'declared' indifference, but as I must think, a covert 'real' zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Basler2|Basler (1953)]], p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1854, Lincoln decided to run as a Whig for the U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. At that time in Illinois, senators were elected by the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oates|Oates]], p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly, once his support began to dwindle, Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for [[Lyman Trumbull]], who defeated opponent [[Joel Aldrich Matteson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], pp. 205–208.&lt;/ref&gt; The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Lincoln said, &quot;I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist, even though I do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery.&quot; Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party, and on disenchanted Free Soil, Liberty, and Democratic party members, he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McGovern|McGovern]], pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Republican convention in 1856, Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1857–58, Douglas broke with President [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]], leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]], which would have admitted Kansas as a [[slave state]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oates|Oates]], pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its controversial pro-slavery decision in [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]; Chief Justice Taney opined that blacks were not citizens, and derived no rights from the Declaration of Independence or Constitution. Lincoln, though strong in his disagreement with the Court's opinion, was as a lawyer unequivocal in his deference to the Court's authority. Lincoln historian [[David Herbert Donald]] provides Lincoln's immediate reaction to the decision, showing his evolving position on slavery: &quot;The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U.S. Senate in 1858 (the second instance of this in the country), Lincoln then delivered [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|his famous speech]]: &quot;&amp;nbsp;'A house divided against itself cannot stand'.([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 3:25) I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harris|Harris]], p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. Senator.

===Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech===
The 1858 campaign featured the seven [[Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858]], generally considered the most famous political debates in American history.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McPherson2|McPherson (1993)]], p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln had found clarity and renewed political purpose to challenge Douglas, author of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which allowed slavery to extend across the 36° 31' parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer (2008), ''Giants'', pp. 187–189.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln warned that &quot;[[The Slave Power]]&quot; was threatening the values of [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal, while Douglas emphasized his [[Freeport Doctrine]], that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 214–224.&lt;/ref&gt; The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew huge crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas's [[popular sovereignty]] theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas had stated that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the [[Dred Scott]] decision.&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer (2008), ''Giants'', pp. 194–197, 200, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln Douglas Debates 1958 issue-4c.jpg|thumb|left|alt=4 cent stamp with a drawing of Lincoln giving a speech to a crowd.|US Postage, 1958 issue, commemorating the Lincoln-Douglas debates]]
Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Carwardine|Carwardine]], pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the ''Illinois Staats-Anzeiger,'' a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 [[German Americans]] voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 242, 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]] to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any &quot;groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jaffa|Jaffa]], p. 473.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly&lt;ref&gt;[[#Holzer|Holzer (2004)]] pp. 108–11.&lt;/ref&gt;—Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination. Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, &quot;No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Carwardine|Carwardine]], p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Holzer|Holzer (2004)]], p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Donald described the speech as a &quot;superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's ([[William H. Seward]]) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's ([[Salmon P. Chase]]) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions, Lincoln said, &quot;The taste ''is'' in my mouth a little.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1860 Presidential nomination and election===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1860}}

[[File:The Rail Candidate.jpg|thumb|alt=Lincoln being carried by two men on a long board.|&quot;The Rail Candidate&quot;—Lincoln's 1860 candidacy depicted as held up by the slavery issue—a slave on the left and party organization on the right, ''[[New York Tribune]]'', [[Horace Greeley]], ed.]]

On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis, Norman Judd, Leonard Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oates|Oates]], pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; Tapping on the distorted legend of his pioneering days with his father, Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of &quot;The Rail Candidate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, at the [[1860 Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], Lincoln became the Republican candidate on the third ballot, beating candidates such as William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sandburg|Sandburg]], pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Democrat Hannibal Hamlin of Maine received the nomination for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's nomination has been attributed in part to his moderate views on slavery, as well as his support of internal improvements and the protective tariff. In terms of the actual balloting, Pennsylvania put him over the top. (Lincoln made known to Pennsylvania iron interests his support for protective tariffs.) Lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others, while following Lincoln's strong dictate to &quot;Make no contracts that bind me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 247–250.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boritt|Boritt]], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Slave Power, as it tightened its grasp on the national government with the Dred Scott decision and the presidency of James Buchanan. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boritt|Boritt]], pp. 13, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, with [[Herschel Vespasian Johnson]] as the vice-presidential candidate. Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the Democratic convention, disagreeing with Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected [[John C. Breckinridge]] as their candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nevins1|Nevins (1950)]], pp. 261–272.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of &quot;free labor,&quot; whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold one million copies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nevins1|Nevins (1950)]], pp. 277, 290, 298–305; [[#Luthin|Luthin]], pp. 171, 197–198, 202–203, 210, 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the sixteenth president of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of the new [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]]. He was the first Republican president, winning entirely on the strength of his support in the North; he was not on the ballot in ten states in the South, and won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mansch|Mansch]], p. 61.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---The following site is interesting AND contains this statement: &quot;Lincoln, who was not on the ballot in any southern state&quot;{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/lincoln/essays/biography/3 |title=American President: Abraham Lincoln: Campaigns and Elections |publisher=Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia |accessdate=2009-04-22}}---&gt; Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, Douglas 1,376,957 votes, Breckinridge 849,781 votes, and Bell 588,789 votes. The electoral vote was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. Turnout was 82.2&amp;nbsp;percent, with Lincoln winning the free Northern states. Douglas won Missouri, and split New Jersey with Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harris|Harris]], p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell won Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and Breckinridge won the rest of the South.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;
There were [[Electoral fusion|fusion tickets]] in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to form one ticket in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the electoral college.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nevins1|Nevins (1950)]], p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Lincoln's election became evident, secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edgar|Edgar (1998)]], p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 1860, [[South Carolina]] took the lead; by February 1, 1861, [[Florida]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Texas]] followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald, p. 267&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Potter|Potter]], p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt; The seven states soon declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald, p. 267&quot;&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; The upper South ([[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], Kentucky, [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]]) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Potter|Potter]], pp. 520, 569–570.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There were attempts at compromise, such as the [[Crittenden Compromise]], which would have extended the [[Missouri Compromise|Missouri Compromise line of 1820]],&lt;ref name=White360-361&gt;[[#White|White]], pp. 360–361.&lt;/ref&gt; and which some Republicans even supported. Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, &quot;I will suffer death before I consent...to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln, however, did support the [[Corwin Amendment]] to the Constitution, which had passed in Congress and protected slavery in those states where it already existed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vorenberg|Vorenberg]], p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks before the war, he went so far as to pen a letter to every governor asking for their support in ratifying the Corwin Amendment as a means to avoid secession.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, John A.

[[File:Abraham lincoln inauguration 1861.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large crowd in front of a large building with many pillars.|A photograph of the March 4, 1861 inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of the [[United States Capitol]]]]

En route to his inauguration, President-elect Lincoln [[Baltimore Plot|evaded possible assassins in Baltimore]], who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security, [[Allan Pinkerton]], and on February 23, 1861, arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military security.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 277–279.&lt;/ref&gt;
Lincoln directed his [[Lincoln's first inaugural address|inaugural speech]] to the South, saying, &quot;We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies...The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nevins |first=Allan |title=Emergence of Lincoln: Prologue to Civil War, 1859—1861, Volume 2 |year=1950 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=9780684104164 |pages=458–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of this inaugural address was delivered to California via the newly-created [[Pony Express]] in seven days, three days sooner than advertised and in the midst of the [[Paiute War]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Corbett, ''Orphans Preferred: The Twisted Truth and Lasting Legend of the Pony Express'', Broadway Books, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Lincoln took office, the Confederacy was an established area,&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald, p. 267&quot;/&gt; and no leader of the insurrection proposed rejoining the Union on any terms; the Confederacy selected [[Jefferson Davis]] on February 9, 1861, as their provisional President.&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the [[Peace Conference of 1861]] rendered legislative compromise practically implausible. By March 1861, Lincoln and nearly every Republican leader agreed the Union could not be dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 268, 279.&lt;/ref&gt;

===War begins===
{{Main|American Civil War}}
The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 1996, p. 293&quot;&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], forced them to surrender, and began the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln miscalculated in believing that he could preserve the Union,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nevins2|Nevins (2000)]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and future general [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], then a civilian, visited Lincoln in the [[White House]] during inauguration week and was &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; at Lincoln's seeming failure to realize that &quot;the country was sleeping on a volcano&quot; and the South was &quot;'preparing for war'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sherman|Sherman]], p. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt; Donald concluded Lincoln fairly estimated the events leading to the initiation of war. &quot;His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 1996, p. 293&quot;/&gt;

On April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops&lt;ref name=&quot;Oates, p. 226&quot;&gt;[[#Oates|Oates]], p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; to recapture forts, protect the capital, and &quot;preserve the Union,&quot; which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]] p.302.&lt;/ref&gt; These events forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession, after which the Confederate capital was moved from [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] to Richmond. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland threatened secession,&lt;ref name=&quot;Oates, p. 226&quot;/&gt; but neither they nor the slave state of Delaware seceded.

Troops headed south towards Washington, D.C., to protect the capital in response to Lincoln's call. On April 19, angry secessionist mobs in [[Baltimore]] that controlled the rail links [[Baltimore riot of 1861|attacked Union troops]] traveling to the capital. [[George William Brown]], the [[List of mayors of Baltimore, Maryland|Mayor of Baltimore]], and other suspect Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned as Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heidler2|Heidler (2000)]], p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; John Merryman, a leader in the secessionist group in Maryland, asked Chief Justice Roger Taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus, saying Lincoln's action of holding Merryman without a hearing was unlawful. Lincoln ignored it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assuming command for the Union in the war===
{{Main|Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War}}
[[File:RunningtheMachine-LincAdmin.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=A group of men sitting  at a table as another man creates money on a wooden machine.|&quot;Running the 'Machine'&amp;nbsp;&quot;: An 1864 political cartoon featuring Lincoln; [[William P. Fessenden|William Fessenden]], [[Edwin M. Stanton|Edwin Stanton]], [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], and [[Gideon Welles]] take a swing at the Lincoln administration.]]

As Commander in Chief, Lincoln confronted in the war an unprecedented crisis, and he responded using unprecedented powers which no President had wielded.  He used his war powers to impose a [[Union blockade|blockade]], to disburse funds before appropriation by Congress, and to suspend the writ of [[habeas corpus]], arresting and imprisoning thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers without warrant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Neely|Neely]], p. 253, n. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln from every direction, and occupied most of his time and attention, while he also mourned the death of his son, Willie. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 315, 338–339&lt;/ref&gt; [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and other opponents of the war criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the [[Radical Republicans]] criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 331–333, 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1861, General [[John C. Frémont]] created controversy on the Republican side when he issued, without consulting Lincoln, a proclamation of martial law in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Charges of negligence in his command of the [[Department of the West]] were compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln's efforts to rein him in were futile, and he was given another command in November. This decision, in part, prevented the secession of Kentucky while incurring the violence in the North.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 315–316.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war assumed foreign policy implications in 1861 when James Mason and John Slidell, ministers of the Confederacy to Great Britain and France, boarded the British ship ''Trent'' in Havana, Cuba. The U.S. Navy illegally intercepted the ''Trent'' on the high seas and seized the two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the American public cheered. Lincoln managed to resolve the issue by releasing the two men.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Charles F. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1834388 &quot;The Trent Affair&quot;], ''American Historical Review'', April 1912, Retrieved November 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's foreign policy approach had been initially hands off, due to his inexperience; he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. Seward's initial reaction to the ''Trent'' affair, however, was too bellicose, so Lincoln also turned to Sen. [[Charles Sumner]], the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an expert in British diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his lack of expertise in military affairs, Lincoln studied books from the Library of Congress and devoured the telegraphic reports.  He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success. In January 1862, after numerous complaints about the running of the War Department, Lincoln dismissed the inept Secretary [[Simon Cameron]] and replaced him with [[Edwin Stanton]], a reputedly successful leader.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 325–326.&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 295–296.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days per week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally his wife would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 391, 392.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln grasped the need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg, and understood the importance of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 432–436.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General McClellan===
One of Lincoln's Democrat commanders, General [[George B. McClellan]], refused to move against the enemy as aggressively as Lincoln directed. He became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of a Union defeat at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] and after the retirement of the aged [[Winfield Scott]] in late 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 318—319.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan, a young [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate and railroad executive, took several months to plan and attempt his [[Peninsula Campaign]], with the objective of capturing [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] and then overland to Richmond. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 349–352.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief and appointed [[Henry Wager Halleck]] after McClellan's ''Harrison's Landing Letter'', in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 360, 361.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], a Republican, as head of the new [[Army of Virginia]]. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack. However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nevins1960|Nevins (1960)]], p. 2:159–62.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the CSS ''Virginia'', formerly the USS ''Merrimack'', damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk before being engaged and damaged by the USS ''Monitor''. Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers concerning the battles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 339–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goodwin|Goodwin]], p. 478, 479.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after McClellan's return to command, General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goodwin|Goodwin]], pp. 478–480.&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing Union victory, one of the bloodiest in American history, enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. He had actually written this some time earlier but could not issue it in the wake of previous military defeats.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goodwin|Goodwin]], p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General [[Don Carlos Buell]] likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with [[William Rosecrans]]; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander in Chief.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 389–390.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnside, against the advice of the president, prematurely launched an offensive across the [[Rappahannock River]] and was stunningly defeated by Lee at [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined.  The average monthly desertion rate during 1863 was 4,650, and it increased after Fredericksburg. Lincoln brought in [[Joseph Hooker]], despite his history of loose talk about a military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nevins1960|Nevins (1960)]], pp. 343–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States House of Representatives elections, 1862|The mid-term elections in 1862]] brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the Administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, high new taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus, [[Conscription|the military draft law]], and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest. While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York.  The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York. The Cincinnati ''Gazette'' contended that the voters, &quot;are depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nevins1960|Nevins (1960)]], pp. 318–22, quote on p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about a group of upcoming battle plans, to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston. The Commander in Chief became despondent when none of these plans, at least initially, succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 422–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nevins1960|Nevins (1960)]], pp. 2:432–50&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in Harper's Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which was accepted. He was replaced by [[George Meade]], who proceeded with the troops to follow Lee into Pennsylvania for the [[Gettysburg Campaign]],
which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 444–447.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln began to understand that his wishes as to the movement of Union troops could most effectively be carried out by using his War Secretary or his general-in-chief as an intermediary  with his generals, who resented &quot;civilian&quot; interference with their plans. Even so, he often would continue  to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander in Chief.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p.446.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emancipation Proclamation===
{{Main|Abraham Lincoln on slavery|Emancipation Proclamation}}
[[File:Emancipation proclamation.jpg|thumb|right|Lincoln presents the first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation to his cabinet. Painted by Carpenter in 1864.]]
Lincoln maintained that his power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution. He expected the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. He also sought to persuade the states to accept [[compensated emancipation]] in return for their prohibition of slavery (an offer that took effect only in Washington, D.C.). Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in this manner would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackubin, Thomas O. [http://www.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp ''Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation: The End of Slavery in America''], ''National Review'', March 2004, Retrieved September 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  President Lincoln rejected two emancipation attempts by Maj. Gen. [[John C. Frémont]] in August, 1861 and by Maj. Gen. [[David Hunter]] in May, 1862 on the grounds that it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Guelzo (1999), ''Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President'',  pp. 290, 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1862, Congress passed the Second [[Confiscation Acts|Confiscation Act]], which freed the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt freeing the slaves could only be done by the Commander in Chief using war powers granted by the Constitution. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that &quot;as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as a slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 364, 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a shrewd reply to a denigrating editorial by Horace Greeley of the ''New York Tribune'' which urged emancipation as a prerequisite to military success, the President subordinated the goal of ending slavery to the primary goal of preserving the Union. Privately, Lincoln had concluded at this point that the war could not be won without freeing the slaves, and so it was a necessity &quot;to do more to help the cause&quot;:
{{quote|My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862 and put into effect on January 1, 1863, freed slaves in territories not already under Union control. Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until over three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days after the Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the [[War Governors' Conference]]; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nevins1960|Nevins (1960)]], 2:239–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. Lincoln later sought to incorporate the policy of the proclamation into the Constitution through passage of the 13th Amendment, permanently abolishing slavery throughout the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 396–398.&lt;/ref&gt; He personally lobbied individual Congressmen for the amendment, which was passed by Congress in early 1865 shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 555.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. At first, Lincoln was reluctant to fully implement this program, but by the spring of 1863, he was ready to initiate &quot;a massive recruitment of Negro troops.&quot; In a letter to Andrew Johnson, the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, &quot;The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 430–431.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 431.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Douglass]] once observed that Lincoln was &quot;the first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me I was a Negro.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kendrick, Paul and Stephen [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2009/6/2009_6_36.shtml &quot;Lincoln &amp; Douglass&quot;], ''American Heritage'', Winter 2009, Retrieved November 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gettysburg Address===
{{Main|Gettysburg Address}}
With the great Union victory at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort; this, despite the [[New York Draft Riots]]. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p.453–460.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gettysburg Address, one of the most quoted speeches in history, was delivered at the dedication of the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery|Soldiers' National Cemetery]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], Pennsylvania, on the afternoon of Thursday, November 19, 1863. In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born, not in 1789, but in 1776, &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&quot; He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy would be assured,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p.460–464.&lt;/ref&gt; that &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wills|Wills]], pp. 20, 27, 146.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective – a new founding of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p.465–466.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Grant===
Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. Lincoln was much impressed by the successes of General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in the west, which made him a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after the 1862 [[Battle of Shiloh]], Lincoln had said, &quot;I can't spare this man. He fights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nevins3|Nevins (2000) (Vol. IV)]], pp. 6–17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---the following citation does not support this statement; in fact, these pages center on Lincoln's disagreement with Grant's proposed North Carolina campaign{{cite book |first=Brooks D. |last=Simpson |title=Ulysses S.

[[File:PinkertonLincolnMcClernand.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Three men standing in front of an army tent.|Lincoln, in a [[top hat]], with [[Allan Pinkerton]] and Major General [[John Alexander McClernand]], at Antietam]]

Nevertheless, he had some reservation that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President, as McCllellan then was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and finding none at that time, decided to promote Grant to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress' consent to reinstate for Grant the rarely used full rank of Lieutenant General, once held by George Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 490–492.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864. This is often characterized as a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], given high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had &quot;almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#McPherson5|McPherson (2009)]], p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, &quot;I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 501.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank with every battle, forcing it back to trenches outside [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg, Virginia]], where Grant began a siege. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Kloss, William [http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html &quot;The Peacemakers&quot;], Art In the White House, Abrams, 1992, Retrieved September 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln and the Republican party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced his losses.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 422–424.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] and [[Philip Sheridan|Sheridan]] to destroy plantations and towns in the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. The damage caused by [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] through Georgia totaled more than $100 million by the general's own estimate.&lt;ref&gt;Neely Jr., Mark E. [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/civil_war_history/v050/50.4neely.html &quot;Was the Civil War a Total War?&quot;], ''Kent State Univ. Press'', December 2004, Retrieved November 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Confederate general [[Jubal Anderson Early]] began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During his [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raid on Washington, D.C.]] in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; captain [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] shouted at him, &quot;Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, [[Philip Sheridan]] was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 516–518.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at [[Hampton Roads]]. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 565.&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 1, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the [[Battle of Five Forks]] and nearly encircled Petersburg, prompting Lee to warn Jefferson Davis to evacuate Richmond. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered at [[Appomattox, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#White|White]], p. 668.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1864 re-election===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1864}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1864.svg|300px|alt=Map of the U.S. showing Lincoln winning all the Union states except for Kentucky, New Jersey, and Delaware. The Southern states are not included.|1864 presidential election results|right|thumb]]
When Grant's spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates, Lincoln supported Grant's determination to wear down Lee's Confederate army even at the cost of heavy Union casualties. With an election looming, he easily defeated efforts to deny his renomination. At the Convention, the Republican Party selected [[Andrew Johnson]], a [[War Democrats|War Democrat]] from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate to form a broader coalition. They ran on the new [[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]] ticket, uniting Republicans and War Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p.493–507.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated and a number began looking for a substitute. Acknowledging this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grimsley|Grimsley]], p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Basler2|Basler (1953)]], p. 514.
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope. While the Democratic platform followed the [[Copperheads (politics)|Peace wing]] of the party and called the war a &quot;failure,&quot; their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Lincoln provided Grant with new replacements and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort. Sherman's capture of [[Atlanta]] in September and David Farragut's capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p.531.&lt;/ref&gt; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast, the Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randall|Randall &amp; Current (2000)]], p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln was  re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78% of the Union soldiers' vote.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Paludan|Paludan]], pp. 274–293.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lincoln second.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large crowd in front of a large building with pillars.|Lincoln (in the center) gives a speech at his second inauguration.]]
On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]].  In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will. Historian Mark Noll concludes it ranks &quot;among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Noll|Noll]], p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln said: 
{{quote|Fondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said, &quot;the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether.&quot; With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Basler2|Basler (1953)]], p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
Reconstruction began during the war as Lincoln and his associates pondered questions of how to reintegrate the Southern states and what to do with Confederate leaders and the freed slaves. Lincoln led the &quot;moderates&quot; regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep. [[Thaddeus Stevens]], Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]], political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 471–472.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were reforming from the fall of the Confederacy. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed General Andrew Johnson (the future Vice President and President in 1865) and General Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10% of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to insure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade-Davis Bill]], in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 485–486.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill the late Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals, [[Salmon P. Chase]], who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nevins|Nevins (2000)]], Vol IV., p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

After implementing the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January, 1863 President Lincoln extensively lobbied that slavery be outlawed throughout all the nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln mentioned concerning the slavery issue that a constitutional amendment would &quot;clinch the whole matter&quot;. By December, 1863 a constitutional amendment proposal to outlaw slavery was brought to the Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass; unable to get a 2/3 majority on June 15, 1864 in the House of Representatives. A second attempt, after a long debate in the House, was successful and passed Congress on January 13, 1865 to be ratified by the nation. Lincoln was very grateful that his home state of [[Illinois]] was the first to ratify the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] saying, &quot;This ends the job.&quot;&lt;ref name =&quot;Browne(1913)&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Every-Day Life of Abraham Lincoln |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tVnPBPGL0rUC |author=Francis Fisher Browne |year=1913 |publisher=Browne &amp; Howell Company page=554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Browne (1995), ''The Every-Day Life of Abraham Lincoln'', pp. 677, 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Richmond finally fell in April 1865, Lincoln went to the vanquished Confederate capital. As he walked through the city, Whites were stonefaced, but [[freedmen]] greeted him as a hero. When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 509–512.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]] and the war was effectively over.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 589.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redefining Republicanism===
Lincoln's rhetoric defined the issues of the war for the nation, the world, and posterity. The Gettysburg Address defied Lincoln's own prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.&quot; In recent years, historians have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]. As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], Lincoln redirected emphasis to the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] as the foundation of American political values—what he called the &quot;sheet anchor&quot; of republicanism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jaffa|Jaffa]], p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, rather than the Constitution's tolerance of slavers, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diggins|Diggins]], p. 307.
&lt;/ref&gt; His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Foner|Foner]], p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a &quot;republican form of government&quot; in every state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jaffa|Jaffa]], p. 263.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1861, in his famous [[Lincoln's first inaugural address|First Inaugural Address]], Lincoln explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system.  He said &quot;A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Belz|Belz]], p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic measures===
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald2|Donald (2001)]], p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed the [[Homestead Act]] in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]], also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Paludan|Paludan]], p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McPherson2|McPherson (1993)]] pp. 450–452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a new Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third [[Morrill Tariff]], the first having become law under James Buchanan. In 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Revenue Act of 1861]], creating the first U.S. [[income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; This created a [[flat tax]] of 3% on incomes above $800 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|800|1861}}}} in current dollars), which was later changed by the [[Revenue Act of 1862]] to a progressive rate structure.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Paludan|Paludan]], p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the [[National Banking Act]] provided a strong financial network in the country.  It also established a national currency. In 1862, Congress created, with Lincoln's approval, the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 2001 p. 424&quot;&gt;[[#Donald2|Donald (2001)]], p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the &quot;[[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux Uprising]]&quot; in [[Minnesota]]. Presented with 303 [[execution warrant|death warrants]] for convicted [[Sioux#Santee (Isáŋyathi or Eastern Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for [[Capital punishment|execution]] (one was later [[pardon|reprieved]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cox|Cox]],  p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the ''New York World'' and the ''Journal of Commerce''  published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 501–502.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abraham Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]] in the United States. Prior to Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had only been proclaimed by the federal government sporadically, and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation was during [[James Madison|James Madison's]] presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November to be a day of Thanksgiving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/liho/planyourvisit/upload/ThanksgivingSiteBulletin.pdf &quot;1863 Thanksgiving Proclamation&quot;], ''National Park Service'', Retrieved November 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after Lincoln's presidency, the date was changed to the fourth Thursday in November.

==Assassination==

{{main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's burial and exhumation}}
[[File:The Assassination of President Lincoln - Currier and Ives 2.png|thumb|alt=A drawing of Lincoln being shot by Booth while sitting in a theater booth.|&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;Assassination of Abraham Lincoln.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8pt&quot;&gt; From left to right: [[Henry Rathbone]], [[Clara Harris]], Mary Todd Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln, and [[John Wilkes Booth]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]]
In 1864, [[John Wilkes Booth]], a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland, formulated a plan to [[kidnapping|kidnap]] Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harrison2000|Harrison (2000)]], pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Learning that the President and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] would be attending [[Ford's Theatre]], Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward.  Without his main bodyguard, [[Ward Hill Lamon]], Lincoln left to attend the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' on April 14, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 594–597.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Abraham Lincoln 1866 Issue-15c.jpg|thumb|upright|left|&lt;center&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;The first Lincoln postage stamp&lt;center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
----
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:8pt&quot;&gt;U.S. Postage 1866 Issue. On the first anniversary of Lincoln's assassination, the U.S. Post Office issued a [[US Presidents on US postage stamps|memorial stamp]] honoring the fallen President.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Haimann, Alexander T. [http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&amp;cmd=1&amp;tid=2027718 &quot;15-cent Lincoln&quot;], ''Arago'', May 16, 2006, Retrieved October 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during intermission to join Lincoln's coachman for drinks in the Star Saloon next door. The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 p.m., aimed at the back of Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major [[Henry Rathbone]] momentarily grappled with Booth but Booth stabbed him and escaped.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 597.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Paul [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Lincolns-Missing-Bodyguard.html &quot;Lincoln's Missing Bodyguard&quot;], ''Smithsonian Magazine'', April 8, 2010, Retrieved November 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

After being on the run for ten days, Booth was tracked down and found at Garrett's farm in Virginia, some 30 miles south of Washington D.C. After a brief fight, Booth was killed by Union soldiers on April 26.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 599.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Army surgeon, Doctor [[Charles Leale]], initially assessed Lincoln's wound as [[Mortal wound|mortal]]. The dying man  was taken across the street  to [[Petersen House]]. After being in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 a.m. on April 15. Presbyterian minister [[Phineas Densmore Gurley]], then present, was asked to offer a prayer, after which Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said, &quot;Now he belongs to the ages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], pp. 598–599, 686.  Witnesses have provided other versions of the quote, i.e. &quot;He now belongs to the ages.&quot; and &quot;He is a man for the ages.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bare headed Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. Vice President Johnson was sworn in as President at 10:00 a.m. the day after the assassination. Lincoln lay in state at the Capitol,  in the East Room and then in the Rotunda, before the funeral train bore him to his final resting place in Springfield.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Foote|Foote]], pp. 986–987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious and philosophical beliefs==
{{See|Abraham Lincoln and religion}}
[[File:Abraham Lincoln by George Peter Alexander Healy.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting of Lincoln sitting with his hand on his chin and his elbow on his leg.|Lincoln, painted by [[George Peter Alexander Healy]] in 1869]]

In recent decades, some scholars have emphasized Lincoln's  ongoing religious skepticism while others have argued his beliefs evolved during the 1850s and gravitated toward an acceptance of mainstream evangelical Protestantism during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;For the historiography see Von Bothmer, Bernard &quot;Devout Believer or Skeptic Politician? An Overview of Historians'  Analyses of Abraham Lincoln's Religion: 1959—2001.&quot; ''Lincoln Herald,'' December 2005, Vol. 107 Issue 4, pp. 154–166.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though he never joined a church, Lincoln was familiar with the Bible and quoted it often. He had a strong belief in a [[Divine providence|Providence]] whose purposes were not discernible. His integration of religion and politics, according to historian Mark Noll, gives Lincoln enduring relevance as the nation's greatest public theologian.&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Mark &quot;Lincoln's God,&quot; ''Journal of Presbyterian History,'' May 2004, Vol. 82 Issue 2, pp. 77–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have debated whether Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language reflected his own personal beliefs or was a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine, Richard J. &quot;Lincoln, Evangelical Religion, and American Political Culture in the Era of the Civil War,&quot; ''Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association,'' January 1997, Vol. 18 Issue 1, pp. 27–55,&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 1850s, Lincoln  acknowledged &quot;providence&quot; in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; instead, he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence. However, during the course of the Civil War (and the deaths of his children), Lincoln more frequently acknowledged his own need to depend on God and to seek to fulfill what he perceived to be God's purposes in the war, including the emancipation of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Parrillo, Nicholas &quot;Lincoln's Calvinist Transformation: Emancipation and War,&quot; ''Civil War History,'' September 2000, Vol. 46 Issue 3, pp. 227–53.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, historians have viewed Lincoln's second inaugural address in terms of the tradition of the Puritan sermon. Lincoln drew on biblical concepts and rhetoric to expose the nation's errors, notably the national sin of slavery, for which the prolonged punishment of the Civil War was God's judgment and punishment. Continuing in the [[jeremiad]] tradition, he prayed for an end to the war, called for forgiveness, and expressed hope for divine grace.&lt;ref&gt;Tackach, James &quot;Abraham Lincoln's Election Jeremiad: The Second Inaugural Address,&quot; ''Studies in Puritan American Spirituality,'' December 2004, Vol. 8, pp. 147–169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's theology, according to biographer [[James G. Randall]], resembled [[Unitarianism]].  He felt that all human kind would go to heaven and no one would go to hell.  He did not believe in the supernatural account of the birth of Christ.  He often talked of God, but rarely mentioned Jesus as the Savior—seldom mentioning Jesus at all.  Many of his ancestors were Quakers, and he deeply sympathized with their religion.  Like many Quakers, he experienced a sense of mysticism, the sense of direct communication with the unseen.  He was involved in several séances at the White House, sponsored by his wife, but did not himself become a spiritualist. Lincoln had numerous superstitious beliefs, and sensed that his dreams were omens of the future; throughout his life, he had a strongly fatalistic attitude. He saw himself as an instrument in the hands of God; becoming, in Randall's view, &quot;a man of more intense religiosity than any other President of the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randal|Randall]], pp. 373–377.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Lincoln largely rejected organized religion, but the [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] &quot;doctrine of necessity&quot; would remain a factor throughout his life. In 1846, Lincoln described the effect of this doctrine as &quot;that the human mind is impelled to action, or held in rest by some power, over which the mind itself has no control.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln's moral and intellectual development and perspectives. There was no teacher, mentor, church leader, community leader, or peer referenced by Lincoln as a singular influence on his intellectual development. Lincoln's personal philosophy was shaped, not by a formal education, but by &quot;an amazingly retentive memory and a passion for reading and learning.&quot; It was Lincoln's reading, rather than his relationships, that were most influential in shaping his personal beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;zsafth&quot;&gt;[[#Guelzo|Guelzo]], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], pp. 57–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, Lincoln's religious skepticism was fueled by his readings in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[economic liberalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zsafth&quot;/&gt; As a member of the Whig party, Lincoln would often use the Declaration of Independence as the expression of these two philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Guelzo|Guelzo]], p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1860, in a speech in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], Connecticut, Lincoln said, regarding slavery, &quot;Whenever this question shall be settled, it must be settled on some philosophical basis. No policy that does not rest upon some philosophical public opinion can be permanently maintained.&quot; The philosophical basis for Lincoln's beliefs regarding slavery and other issues of the day require that Lincoln be examined &quot;seriously as a man of ideas.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guelzo, pp. 18–19&quot;&gt;[[#Guelzo|Guelzo]], pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech given on February 22, 1861 at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Lincoln said, &quot;I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence.&amp;nbsp;...It was not the mere matter of the separation of the Colonies from the motherland; but that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but, I hope, to the world, for all future time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jaffa|Jaffa]], p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

He found in the Declaration justification for Whig economic policy and opposition to the expansion of slavery and the [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] platform of the [[Know Nothing]]s. In claiming that all men were created free, Lincoln and the Whigs argued that this freedom required economic advancement, expanded education, territory to grow, and the ability of the nation to absorb the growing immigrant population.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Guelzo|Guelzo]], pp. 194–195.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the Declaration as more than a political document. To him, as well as to many abolitionists and other antislavery leaders, it established valuable principles which shaped the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Lincoln matured, especially during his time as president, the idea of a divine will somehow interacting with human affairs increasingly influenced his beliefs and public expressions. On a personal level, the death of his son Willie in February 1862 caused Lincoln to look towards religion for answers and solace.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilson|Wilson]], pp. 251–254.&lt;/ref&gt; More than any political leader of the day, he fashioned public policy into a mold of religious, perhaps Calvinistic language, that avoided the evangelical, revivalist fervor of the [[Second Great Awakening]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guelzo, pp. 18–19&quot;/&gt; After Willie's death, in the summer or early fall of 1862, Lincoln attempted to put on paper his private thoughts on why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary.  He wrote that God &quot;could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilson|Wilson]], p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1864, in justifying his actions regarding Emancipation, Lincoln wrote, &quot;I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 1996, p. 514&quot;&gt;[[#Donald|Donald (1996)]], p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1864, when the Union Army was suffering severe casualties, Lincoln drew solace from the Bible. To his friend [[Joshua Speed]], he said, &quot;Take all of this book [the Bible] upon reason that you can, and the balance on faith, and you will live and die a happier and better man.&quot; He is also quoted as saying, &quot;this Great Book...is the best gift God has given to man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald 1996, p. 514&quot;/&gt;

President Lincoln's assassination and death immediately made him a national martyr and myth. To abolitionists, Lincoln was viewed as a champion for &quot;human liberty&quot;.  Killed on [[Good Friday]], Lincoln was identified as Christ-like.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Reed Turner, ''Beware the People Weeping: Public Opinion and the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln'' (1991) pp 25–52&lt;/ref&gt; For generations, Lincoln's name was linked with the Republican party, and synonymous with &quot;freedom and union&quot; during national elections.  Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Beware the People Weeping'' pp 90–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chesebrough|Chesebrough]], pp. 76, 79, 106, 110; Current (1988), ''The Lincoln Nobody Knows'', pp. 230–233; 282–284&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lincoln is regarded by the public and historians in numerous polls as one of the [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|greatest presidents in U.S. history]], usually in the top three, along with George Washington and Franklin D. Roosevelt.  A study published in 2004 found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Taranto|Taranto]], p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Aristotelianism}}
'''Aristotle''' ({{lang-el|Ἀριστοτέλης}}, ''Aristotélēs'') (384 BC&amp;nbsp;– 322 BC)&lt;ref&gt;That these undisputed dates (the first half of the Olympiad year 384/3, and in 322 shortly before the death of Demosthenes) are correct was shown already by [[August Boeckh]] (''Kleine Schriften'' VI 195); for further discussion, see [[Felix Jacoby]] on ''[[FGrHist]]'' 244 F 38. Ingemar Düring, ''Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition'', Göteborg, 1957, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Greeks|Greek]] philosopher, a student of [[Plato]] and teacher of [[Alexander the Great]]. His writings cover many subjects, including [[Physics (Aristotle)|physics]], [[metaphysics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]], theater, music, logic, [[rhetoric]], linguistics, politics, government, ethics, biology, and zoology. Together with Plato and [[Socrates]] (Plato's teacher), Aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in Western philosophy. Aristotle's writings were the first to create a comprehensive system of Western philosophy, encompassing morality and aesthetics, logic and science, politics and metaphysics.

Aristotle's views on the [[Aristotelian physics|physical sciences]] profoundly shaped medieval scholarship, and their influence extended well into the [[Renaissance]], although they were ultimately replaced by [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]. In the zoological sciences, some of his observations were confirmed to be accurate only in the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern [[formal logic]]. In metaphysics, [[Aristotelianism]] had a profound influence on [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800 - 1400)|philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions]] in the [[Middle Ages]], and it continues to influence [[Christian theology]], especially the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]]. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues ([[Cicero]] described his literary style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Life==
Aristotle was born in [[Stageira]], [[Chalcidice]], in 384 BC, about {{convert|55|km|0|abbr=on}} east of modern-day [[Thessaloniki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Aristotle: The Great Philosophers | author = McLeisch, Kenneth Cole| publisher = Routledge | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-415-92392-1 | page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]] was the personal physician to [[Amyntas III of Macedon|King Amyntas of Macedon]]. Aristotle was trained and educated as a member of the [[aristocracy]]. At about the age of eighteen, he went to [[Athens]] to continue his education at [[Platonic Academy|Plato's Academy]]. Aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years before quitting Athens in 348/47 BC. The traditional story about his departure reports that he was disappointed with the direction the academy took after control passed to Plato's nephew [[Speusippus]] upon his death, although it is possible that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiments and left before Plato had died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lord Intro&quot;&gt;Carnes Lord, Introduction to ''The Politics'', by Aristotle (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; He then traveled with [[Xenocrates]] to the court of his friend [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in Asia Minor. While in Asia, Aristotle traveled with [[Theophrastus]] to the island of [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], where together they researched the [[botany]] and zoology of the island. Aristotle married Hermias's adoptive daughter (or niece) [[Pythias]]. She bore him a daughter, whom they named Pythias. Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon]] to become the tutor to his son [[Alexander the Great]] in 343 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;&gt;Bertrand Russell, &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot;, Simon &amp; Schuster, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Early Islamic portrayal of Aristotle]]
Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of [[Macedon]]. During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]]. In his ''Politics'', Aristotle states that only one thing could justify monarchy, and that was if the virtue of the king and his family were greater than the virtue of the rest of the citizens put together. Tactfully, he included the young prince and his father in that category. Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and his attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be 'a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants'.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, ''Alexander of Macedon'', 1991 University of California Press, Ltd. Oxford, England. Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data, p.58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

By 335 BC he had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of Stageira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]]. According to the [[Suda]], he also had an [[eromenos]], [[Palaephatus|Palaephatus of Abydus]].&lt;ref&gt;William George Smith,''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. 3, [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2421.html p. 88]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is during this period in Athens from 335 to 323 BC when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;/&gt; Aristotle wrote many dialogues, only fragments of which survived. The works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication, as they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[De Anima]] (On the Soul)'' and ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.

Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In physical science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy, [[embryology]], geography, geology, meteorology, physics and zoology. In philosophy, he wrote on aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, economics, psychology, rhetoric and theology. He also studied education, foreign customs, literature and poetry. His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge. It has been suggested that Aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of Alexander's life, Alexander began to suspect plots against himself, and threatened Aristotle in letters. Aristotle had made no secret of his contempt for Alexander's pretense of divinity, and the king had executed Aristotle's grandnephew [[Callisthenes]] as a traitor. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but there is little evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Green, ''Alexander of Macedon'', 1991 University of California Press, Ltd. Oxford, England. Library of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data, p.379,459&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens once again flared. [[Eurymedon the hierophant]] denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honor. Aristotle fled the city to his mother's family estate in [[Chalcis]], explaining, &quot;I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

However, he died in Euboea of [[natural causes]] within the year (in 322 BC). Aristotle named chief executor his student [[Antipater]] and left a [[Will (law)|will]] in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt by Hildegard Temporini, Wolfgang

==Logic==

{{Main|Term logic}}
{{details|Non-Aristotelian logic}}

With the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of [[formal logic]], and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th century advances in [[mathematical logic]]. [[Kant]] stated in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' that Aristotle's theory of logic completely accounted for the core of [[deductive inference]].

===History===
Aristotle &quot;says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last =Bocheński
 | first =I. M.
 | title =Ancient Formal Logic

 | location =Amsterdam
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Plato reports that [[syntax]] was devised before him, by [[Prodicus of Ceos]], who was concerned by the correct use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from [[dialectics]]; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a [[deducting system]], he could never actually construct one and relied instead on his [[dialectic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bocheński, 1951&quot;&gt;Bocheński, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] would logically follow. Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', where he introduced his division method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Analytics and the ''Organon''===
{{Main|Organon}}
What we today call ''Aristotelian logic'', Aristotle himself would have labeled &quot;analytics&quot;. The term &quot;logic&quot; he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century AD:
#''Categories''
#''On Interpretation''
#''Prior Analytics''
#''Posterior Analytics''
#''Topics''
#''On Sophistical Refutations''

The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the ''Categories,'' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in ''On Interpretation'', to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the ''Analytics'') and dialectics (in the ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations''). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory ''stricto sensu'': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the ''Organon'', namely the fourth book of ''Metaphysics.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Bocheński, 1951&quot;/&gt;

==Aristotle's scientific method==
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]''&lt;!-- this should link to an article about the famous artwork --&gt;, a fresco by [[Raphael]]. Aristotle gestures to the earth, representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience, while holding a copy of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' in his hand, whilst Plato gestures to the heavens, representing his belief in [[The Forms]].]]
{{details|Aristotle's theory of universals}}

Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]. Aristotle, however, found the universal in [[particular]] things, which he called the essence of things, while Plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their [[prototype]] or [[exemplar]]. For Aristotle, therefore, philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) to a contemplation of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, &quot;form&quot; still refers to the unconditional basis of [[phenomena]] but is &quot;instantiated&quot; in a particular substance (see ''[[Aristotle#Universals and particulars|Universals and particulars]]'', below). In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], while Plato's is essentially deductive from ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aristotle's terminology, &quot;natural philosophy&quot; is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. In modern times, the scope of ''philosophy'' has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the [[scientific method]]. In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.

In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as &quot;science&quot;. Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term &quot;scientific method&quot;. For Aristotle, &quot;all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical&quot; (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, [[mathematics]] and metaphysics.

If logic (or &quot;analytics&quot;) is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) [[Logic]]; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics and Mathematics; (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.

In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform [[original research]] in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.

Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.

His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example, in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''History of Animals'', 2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, [[John Philoponus]], and later [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/#2.2 |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Aristotle refuted [[Democritus]]'s claim that the [[Milky Way]] was made up of &quot;those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,&quot; pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given &quot;current astronomical demonstrations&quot; that &quot;the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then...the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Meteorology'' 1.8, trans. E.W. Webster, rev. J. Barnes.&lt;/ref&gt;

In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the universe' from simple observation and over-stretched [[reason]]. Today's scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.

Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the ''Metaphysics'', which was widely accepted up until the 16th century. From the 3rd century to the 16th century, the dominant view held that the Earth was the center of the universe ([[geocentrism]]).

Since he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|Burent, John.]] 1928. ''Platonism'', Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 61, 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.

==Physics==
{{Main|Physics (Aristotle)}}

===The five elements===
{{Main|Classical element}}
Concerning the make up of [[matter]], Aristotle followed prior Greek philosophy with an adapted theory of elements. He was not an &quot;[[atomism|atomist]]&quot; like [[Democritus]]. In particular he proposed a fifth element, aether, in addition to the more common four.
*[[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], which is hot and dry.
*[[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], which is cold and dry.
*[[Air (classical element)|Air]], which is hot and wet.
*[[Water (classical element)|Water]], which is cold and wet.
*[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], which is the divine substance that makes up the [[Celestial spheres|heavenly spheres]] and heavenly bodies (stars and planets).

Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place; the earth at the centre of the universe, then water, then air, then fire. When they are out of their natural place they have natural motion, requiring no external cause, which is towards that place; so bodies sink in water, air bubbles rise up, rain falls, flame rises in air. The heavenly element has perpetual circular motion.

===Motion===
{{Main|potentiality and actuality}}

[[Motion]] in Aristotle is defined in his [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]] in a way which is quite different from [[modern science]], and Aristotle's understanding of motion is closely connected to his actuality-potentiality distinction (see below concerning metaphysics). Taken literally, Aristotle defines motion as the actuality of a potentiality ''as such''.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 201a10-11, 201a27-29, 201b4-5&lt;/ref&gt; What Aristotle meant is the subject of several different interpretations, but because actuality and potentiality are normally opposites in Aristotle, interpreters either say that the wording which has come down to us is wrong, or that the addition of the &quot;as such&quot; to the definition is critical to understanding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|last=Sachs|first=Joe|title=Aristotle: Motion and its Place in Nature|year=2005|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-mot/|journal=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causality, The Four Causes===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Retrocausality]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
{{Main|Four causes}}
*[[Material cause]] describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel. It is not about action. It does not mean one domino knocks over another domino.
*The [[formal cause]] is its form, i.e. the arrangement of that matter.  It tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter. Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation. A more simple example of the formal cause is the blueprint or plan that one has before making or causing a human made object to exist.
*The [[efficient cause]] is &quot;the primary source&quot;, or that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. More simply again that which immediately sets the thing in motion. So take the two dominos this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over. This is effectively efficient cause.
*The [[final cause]] is its purpose, or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve, or it is that from which and that to which the change is. This also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition, need, motivation or motives, rational, irrational, ethical, and all that gives purpose to behavior.

Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event (not necessarily a mental goal). Taking our two dominos, it requires someone to intentionally knock the dominos over as they cannot fall themselves.

Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.

Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. The earliest known written evidence of a [[camera obscura]] can be found in Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350 BC in ''Problemata''. Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or [[aperture]], to allow for sunlight to enter. Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. In modern cameras, this is analogous to the [[Diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]]. Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Lahanas |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Optics.htm |title=Optics and ancient Greeks |publisher=Mlahanas.de |date= |accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chance and spontaneity===
According to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[sumbebekos|accidental things]]. It is &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot; (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of &quot;chance&quot; it might be better to think of &quot;coincidence&quot;: Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place. For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.

There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names &quot;luck&quot;, that can only apply to human beings, since it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. &quot;What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 2.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphysics==
[[File:Uni Freiburg - Philosophen 4.jpg|thumb|Statue of Aristotle (1915) by Cipri Adolf Bermann at the [[University of Freiburg]] [[Freiburg im Breisgau|im Breisgau]]]]
{{Main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle defines metaphysics as &quot;the knowledge of [[immaterial]] being,&quot; or of &quot;being in the highest degree of [[abstraction]].&quot; He refers to metaphysics as &quot;first philosophy&quot;, as well as &quot;the theologic science.&quot;

===Substance, potentiality and actuality===
{{See also|Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle examines the concept of substance and essence (''[[ousia]]'') in his ''Metaphysics'', Book VII and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. As he proceeds to the book VIII, he concludes that the matter of the substance is the [[Material substratum|substratum]] or the stuff of which it is composed, ''e.g.'' the matter of the house are the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house. While the form of the substance, is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] (see also [[predicables]]). The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1043a 10–30&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the change (''[[kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]] and [[On Generation and Corruption]] 319b-320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from: 1) growth and diminution, which is change in quantity; 2) locomotion, which is change in space; and 3) alteration, which is change in quality.

The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form.

Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''[[poiein]]'') or 'be acted upon' (''[[paschein]]''), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting).

Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' IX 1050a 5–10&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.

With this [[definition]] of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, &quot;what is it that makes a man one&quot;? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1045a-b&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universals and particulars===
{{Main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}

Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.

Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but &quot;good&quot; is still a proper universal form. [[Bertrand Russell]] is a contemporary philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of &quot;uninstantiated universals&quot;.

Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.

In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.

==Biology and medicine==
In Aristotelian science, most especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. He dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.

===Empirical research program===
[[File:Octopus3.jpg|thumb|Octopus swimming]]
[[File:Torpedo fuscomaculata2.jpg|thumb|''Torpedo fuscomaculata'']]
[[File:Triakis semifasciata.jpg|thumb|Leopard shark]]

Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of [[Lesbos]], and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, such as ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', and ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on [[catfish]], [[Electric ray|electric fish]] (''[[Torpedo (genus)|Torpedo]]'') and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]]s, namely, ''[[Octopus]]'', ''Sepia'' ([[cuttlefish]]) and the paper nautilus (''[[Argonauta argo]]''). His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]] was about two thousand years ahead of its time, and widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē ([[selachians]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, Charles 1931&quot;&gt;Singer, Charles. ''A short history of biology''. Oxford 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another good example of his methods comes from the ''Generation of Animals'' in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated.

He gave accurate descriptions of [[ruminant]]s' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark]] ''[[Mustelus mustelus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Kearns, &quot;Animals, knowledge about,&quot; in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 3rd ed., 1996, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of living things===
Aristotle's classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the 19th century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood' (he was not to know that complex invertebrates do make use of [[haemoglobin]], but of a different kind from vertebrates). Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (humans and mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs). In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of [[Linnaeus]], who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms).

For [[Charles Singer]], &quot;Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a ''scala naturae''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, Charles 1931&quot;/&gt; Aristotle's ''History of Animals'' classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical &quot;[[Great chain of being|Ladder of Life]]&quot; (''scala naturae''), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, of course, is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., [[final cause]]s, guided all natural processes. Such a [[teleological]] view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that &quot;no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns,&quot; and &quot;a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen,&quot; Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the ''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 201–202; see also: Lovejoy, ''The Great Chain of Being''&lt;/ref&gt; His system had eleven grades, arranged according &quot;to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality&quot;, expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs.

Aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.

He placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''De Anima'' II 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 45&lt;/ref&gt; Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of [[Alcmaeon of Croton|Alcmaeon]].&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, ''A History of Greek Philosophy'' Vol. 1 pp. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

===Successor: Theophrastus===
[[File:161Theophrastus 161 frontespizio.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece to a 1644 version of the expanded and illustrated edition of ''[[Historia Plantarum]]'' (ca. 1200), which was originally written around 200 BC]]
{{Main|Theophrastus|Historia Plantarum}}
Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on botany—the ''History of Plants''—which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the [[Middle Ages]]. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as ''carpos'' for fruit, and ''pericarpion'' for seed vessel.

Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the [[efficient cause]]. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90–91; Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'', p 46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Hellenistic medicine===
{{details|Medicine in ancient Greece}}
After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref&gt;Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'' pp 252&lt;/ref&gt; It is not until the age of [[Alexandria]] under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] that advances in biology can be again found.

The first medical teacher at Alexandria, [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp 56&lt;/ref&gt; Though a few ancient [[atomism|atomists]] such as [[Lucretius]] challenged the [[teleology|teleological]] viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, [[natural theology]]) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Ernst Mayr]] claimed that there was &quot;nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', pp 90–94; quotation from p 91&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref&gt;Annas, ''Classical Greek Philosophy'', p 252&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical philosophy==
===Ethics===
{{Main|Aristotelian ethics}}

Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.

Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the ''[[De Anima|psuchē]]'' (normally translated as ''soul'') in accordance with reason (''[[logos]]''). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as &quot;happiness&quot; or sometimes &quot;well being&quot;. To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''ēthikē'' ''[[aretē]]''), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book I. See for example chapter 7 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1098a 1098a].&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''[[phronēsis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished [[theory|theoretical]] or speculative thinker, or in other words, a [[philosophy|philosopher]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{Main|Politics (Aristotle)}}
In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the [[family]] which in turn is prior to the individual, &quot;for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Politics 1253a19-24&lt;/ref&gt; He is also famous for his statement that &quot;man is by nature a political animal.&quot; Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an [[organism]] rather than like a [[machine]], and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Ebenstein | first =Alan | coauthors =William Ebenstein | title =Introduction to Political Thinkers | publisher =Wadsworth Group | year =2002 | page =59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different to Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions as a political &quot;community&quot; or &quot;partnership&quot; (''koinōnia'')&lt;!-- (1252a1) --&gt;. The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability&lt;!-- (1280b29-31) --&gt;, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: &quot;The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together&lt;!-- (1281a1-3) --&gt;.&quot; This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of &quot;fear of violent death&quot; or its &quot;inconveniences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For a different reading of social and economic processes in the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and ''Politics'' see Polanyi, K. (1957) &quot;Aristotle Discovers the Economy&quot; in ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies: Essays of Karl Polanyi'' ed. G. Dalton, Boston 1971, 78–115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhetoric and poetics===
{{Main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Poetics (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|imitative]], each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, spectacle, and lyric poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' VI&lt;/ref&gt; The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic [[mimesis]]. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' XXVI&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]].&lt;ref&gt;Temple, Olivia, and Temple, Robert (translators), [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZB-rVxPvtPEC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_0 The Complete Fables By Aesop] Penguin Classics, 1998. ISBN 0140446494 Cf. Introduction, pp. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss and preservation of his works==
{{See also|Corpus Aristotelicum}}
Modern scholarship reveals that Aristotle's &quot;lost&quot; works stray considerably in characterization&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot;&gt;Terence Irwin and Gail Fine, [[Cornell University]], ''Aristotle: Introductory Readings.'' Indianapolis, Indiana: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc. (1996), Introduction, pp. xi–xii.&lt;/ref&gt; from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication, the surviving works do not appear to have been so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot; /&gt; Rather the surviving works mostly resemble lectures unintended for publication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot; /&gt; The authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally Aristotelian is also today held suspect, with some books duplicating or summarizing each other, the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely Aristotle's at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot; /&gt;

Some of the individual works within the corpus, including the ''[[Constitution of Athens]],'' are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotle's &quot;school,&quot; perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision. Others, such as ''On Colors,'' may have been produced by Aristotle's successors at the Lyceum, e.g., [[Theophrastus]] and [[Strato of Lampsacus|Straton]]. Still others acquired Aristotle's name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the ''De Plantis,'' possibly by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]. Other works in the corpus include medieval [[palmistries]] and [[astrological]] and [[magical]] texts whose connections to Aristotle are purely fanciful and self-promotional.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Thorndike, &quot;Chiromancy in Medieval Latin Manuscripts,&quot; ''Speculum'' 40 (1965), pp. 674–706; Roger A. Pack, &quot;Pseudo-Arisoteles: Chiromantia,&quot; ''Archives d’histoire doctrinale et littéraire du Moyen Âge'' 39 (1972), pp. 289–320; Pack, &quot;A Pseudo-Aristotelian Chiromancy,&quot; ''Archives d’histoire doctrinale et littéraire du Moyen Âge'' 36 (1969), pp. 189–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the &quot;[[exoteric]]&quot; and the &quot;[[esoteric]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Barnes]], &quot;Life and Work&quot; in ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'' (1995), p. 12; Aristotle himself: ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1102a26–27. Aristotle himself never uses the term &quot;esoteric&quot; or &quot;acroamatic&quot;. For other passages where Aristotle speaks of ''exōterikoi logoi'', see [[W. D. Ross]], ''Aristotle's Metaphysics'' (1953), vol. 2, pp. 408–410. Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle's own works, usually refers generally to &quot;discussions not peculiar to the [[Peripatetic school]]&quot;, rather than to specific works of Aristotle's own.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works (esoteric) intended for the narrower audience of Aristotle's students and other philosophers who were familiar with the jargon and issues typical of the Platonic and Aristotelian schools. Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant – that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. (''Fragments'' of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that [[Cicero]] refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The surviving texts of Aristotle are technical treatises from within Aristotle's school, as opposed to the [[Corpus_Aristotelicum#Fragments|dialogues and other &quot;exoteric&quot; texts]] he published more widely during his lifetime. In some cases, the Aristotelian texts were likely left in different versions and contexts (as in the overlapping parts of the ''Eudemian Ethics'' and ''Nicomachean Ethics''), or in smaller units that could be incorporated into larger books in different ways. Because of this, a posthumous compiler and publisher may sometimes have played a significant role in arranging the text into the form we know.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

One major question in the history of Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us?&lt;ref&gt;The definitive, English study of these questions is Barnes, &quot;Roman Aristotle&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by [[Strabo]] in his ''Geography'' and [[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sulla.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to [[Neleus of Scepsis]]. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to [[Scepsis]], where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when [[Apellicon of Teos]] discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to [[Rome]], where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] and then by philosopher [[Andronicus of Rhodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Rome: from the early Republic to the assassination of Julius Caesar‎ – Page 513, Matthew Dillon, Lynda Garland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 22‎ – Page 131, Grolier Incorporated – Juvenile Nonfiction&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carnes Lord]] attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides &quot;the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however. First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair. Second, there is &quot;incontrovertible evidence,&quot; Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis. Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his. And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelian interpolations in the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.

As the influence of the ''[[falsafa]]'' grew in the West, in part due to [[Gerard of Cremona]]'s translations and the spread of [[Averroism]], the demand for Aristotle's works grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{SEP|arabic-islamic-influence|Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Moerbeke]] translated a number of them into Latin. When [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote his [[theology]], working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in [[Europe]] to the point where [[Renaissance]] philosophy could be equated with Aristotelianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{SEP|aristotelianism-renaissance|Aristotelianism in the Renaissance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Aristotle. Pentelic marble, copy of the Imperial Period (1st or 2nd century) of a lost [[bronze sculpture]] made by [[Lysippos]]]]
More than twenty-three hundred years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. According to the philosopher [[Bryan Magee]], &quot;it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Magee |first=Bryan |authorlink=Bryan Magee |title=The Story of Philosophy |year=2010 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |page= 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle was the founder of [[formal logic]],&lt;ref&gt;W. K. C. Guthrie (1990). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=8EG0yV0cGoEC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false A history of Greek philosophy: Aristotle : an encounter]''&quot;. [[Cambridge University Press]]. p.156. ISBN 0521387604&lt;/ref&gt; pioneered the study of [[zoology]], and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34560/Aristotle |title=Aristotle (Greek philosopher) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Durant |first=Will |authorlink=Will Durant |title=[[The Story of Philosophy]] |year=1926 (2006) |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. |location=United States |isbn=9780671739164 |page= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these achievements, the influence of Aristotle's errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably. [[Bertrand Russell]] notes that &quot;almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine&quot;. Russell also refers to Aristotle's ethics as &quot;repulsive&quot;, and calls his logic &quot;as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy&quot;. Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.&lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;/&gt;

===Later Greek philosophers===
The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the [[Peripatetic school]]. Aristotle's notable students included [[Aristoxenus]], [[Dicaearchus]], [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], [[Eudemos of Rhodes]], [[Harpalus]], [[Hephaestion]], [[Meno]], [[Mnason of Phocis]], [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], and [[Theophrastus]]. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained &quot;Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Christian theologians===
Aristotle is referred to as &quot;The Philosopher&quot; by [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. See ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', Part I, Question 3, etc. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. The medieval English poet [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] describes his student as being happy by having
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'' at his beddes heed''
:''Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,''
:''Of aristotle and his philosophie,''&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chaucer, ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', Prologue, lines 295–295&lt;/ref&gt;
The Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] says of Aristotle in [[The Divine Comedy|the first circles of hell]],
:''I saw the Master there of those who know,''
:''Amid the philosophic family,''
:''By all admired, and by all reverenced;''
:''There Plato too I saw, and Socrates,''
:''Who stood beside him closer than the rest.''&lt;ref&gt;''vidi ’l maestro di color che sanno''
''seder tra filosofica famiglia.''&lt;/br&gt;
''Tutti lo miran, tutti onor li fanno'':&lt;/br&gt;
''quivi vid’ïo Socrate e Platone''&lt;/br&gt;
''che ’nnanzi a li altri più presso li stanno;''&lt;/br&gt; Dante, ''L’Inferno'' (Hell), Canto IV. Lines 131–135&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on women===
{{Main|Aristotle's views on women}}
Aristotle's analysis of procreation is frequently criticized on the grounds that it presupposes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element; it is on these grounds that Aristotle is considered by some feminist critics to have been a [[Misogyny|misogynist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his Rhetoric that a society cannot be happy unless women are happy too: In places like Sparta where the lot of women is bad, there can only be half-happiness in society.(see Rhetoric 1.5.6)

===Post-Enlightenment thinkers===
The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; However implausible this is, it is certainly the case that Aristotle's rigid separation of action from production, and his justification of the subservience of slaves and others to the virtue – or ''arete'' – of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy. It is [[Martin Heidegger]], not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. More recently, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy'', Polity Press, 2007, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of works==
{{Main|Corpus Aristotelicum}}
The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through Mediæval manuscript transmission are collected in the [[Corpus Aristotelicum]]. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school. Reference to them is made according to the organization of [[Immanuel Bekker]]'s Royal Prussian Academy edition (''Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica'', Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.

[[File:George Gershwin An American in Paris.png|thumb|A theme from George Gershwin's orchestral composition ''An American in Paris'']]
'''''An American in Paris''''' is an extended [[symphony|symphonic]] [[tone poem]] by the American composer [[George Gershwin]], written in 1928. Inspired by the time Gershwin had spent in [[Paris]], it evokes the sights and energy of the [[France|French]] capital in the 1920s. It is one of Gershwin's best-known compositions.

Gershwin composed the piece on commission from the [[New York Philharmonic]]. He also did the [[orchestration]]. (He did not orchestrate his musicals.) Gershwin scored ''An American in Paris'' for the standard instruments of the [[symphony orchestra]] plus [[celesta]], [[saxophone]], and automobile horns. Gershwin brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the [[New York City|New York]] premiere of the composition which took place on December 13, 1928 in [[Carnegie Hall]] with [[Walter Damrosch]] conducting the New York Philharmonic.

Gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]], noting that: &quot;My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere.&quot; When the tone poem moves into the [[blues]], &quot;our American friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of homesickness.&quot; But, &quot;nostalgia is not a fatal disease.&quot; The American visitor &quot;once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life&quot; and &quot;the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant.&quot;

==Instrumentation==
''An American in Paris'' is scored for 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in B flat, [[bass clarinet]] in B flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]s in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in B flat, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], triangle, wood block, [[cymbal]]s, low and high [[Tom-tom drum|tom-tom]]s, [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[celesta]], 4 taxi horns, [[alto saxophone]]/[[soprano saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]]/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, [[baritone saxophone]]/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, and [[String section|strings]].

The revised edition by F Campbell-Watson calls for three saxophones, alto, tenor and baritone. In this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments.

==Recordings==
''An American in Paris'' has been frequently recorded over the years.  The very first recording was made for [[RCA Victor]] in 1929 with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]] conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]].  Gershwin was on hand to &quot;supervise&quot; the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio.  Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief [[celesta]] solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. The radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which ''An American in Paris,'' also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set.  [[Arthur Fiedler]] and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music.  In 1945, [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] recorded the music in [[Carnegie Hall]], one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer. The Seattle Symphony also recorded a version in the 1980s of Gershwin's original score, before he committed to numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.

In 1951, MGM released a musical comedy, ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', featuring [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Leslie Caron]]. Winner of numerous awards, including the 1951 Best Picture Oscar, the film was directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around Gershwin's symphonic poem (arranged for the film by Johnny Green).

A part of the symphonic composition is also featured in ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'', released in 1997.

The '''Academy Award''', also known as the '''Oscar''', is an accolade bestowed by the American [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html |title = About the Academy Awards |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate = April 13, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070407234926/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html |archivedate = April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to recognize excellence of professionals in the [[film industry]], including directors, actors, and writers. The formal ceremony at which the awards are presented is one of the most prominent award ceremonies in the world, and is televised live in more than 200 countries annually. It is also the oldest award ceremony in the media; its equivalents, the [[Grammy Awards]] (for music), [[Emmy Awards]] (for television), and [[Tony Awards]] (for theatre) are modeled after the Academy.

The AMPAS was originally conceived by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] studio boss [[Louis B. Mayer]] as a professional honorary organization to help improve the film industry’s image and help mediate labor disputes. The Oscar itself was later initiated by the Academy as an award &quot;of merit for distinctive achievement&quot; in the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273341,00.html | title=The Birth of Oscar | first=Andrew | last=Essex | publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=May 14, 1999 | accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1st Academy Awards|first Academy Awards]] ceremony was held on May 16, 1929, at the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hotel Roosevelt]] in [[Hollywood]] to honor outstanding film achievements of the 1927/1928 film season. The [[83rd Academy Awards|most recent ceremony]], honoring [[2010 in film|films in 2010]], was held at Hollywood's [[Kodak Theatre]] on February 27, 2011.

== History ==

The first awards were presented on May 16, 1929, at a private brunch at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] with an audience of about 270 people. The post Academy Awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/history.html|title=History of the Academy Awards|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5. Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other personalities of the filmmaking industry of the time for their works during the 1927–1928 period.

Winners had been announced three months earlier of their triumphs; however that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in 1930. Since then and during the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 pm on the night of the awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; This method was used until the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners since 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years. For example, the 2nd Academy Awards presented on April 3, 1930, recognized films that were released between August 1, 1928 and July 31, 1929. Starting with the 7th Academy Awards, held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.

The first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in ''[[The Last Command (film)|The Last Command]]'' and ''[[The Way of All Flesh]]''. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. The honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period; for example, [[Emil Jannings]] received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period. Since the fourth ceremony, the system changed, and the professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film.  As of the 82nd Academy Awards ceremony held in 2010, a total of 2,789 Oscars have been given for 1,825 awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/awards/index.html|title= A Brief History of the Oscar|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = August 4, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080730022318/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/awards/index.html |archivedate = July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 302 actors have won Oscars in competitive acting categories or been awarded Honorary or Juvenile Awards.

The 1939 film ''[[Beau Geste (1939 film)|Beau Geste]]'' is the only movie (non-documentary) that features as many as four Academy Award winners for Best Actor in a Leading Role ([[Gary Cooper]], [[Ray Milland]], [[Susan Hayward]], [[Broderick Crawford]]).

At the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the [[Best Foreign Language Film]] category was introduced. Until then, foreign language films were honored with the Special Achievement Award.

== Oscar statuette ==
=== Design ===

Although there are seven other types of awards presented by the Academy (the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, the Gordon E. Sawyer Award, the Scientific and Engineering Award, the Technical Achievement Award, the John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation, and the Student Academy Award), the best known one is the ''Academy Award of Merit'' more popularly known as the Oscar [[statuette]]. Made of gold-plated [[britannia metal|britannium]] on a black metal base, it is 13.5&amp;nbsp;in (34&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&amp;nbsp;lb (3.85&amp;nbsp;kg) and depicts a [[knight]] rendered in [[Art Deco]] style holding a [[crusade|crusader's]] [[sword]] standing on a [[reel]] of film with five spokes. The five spokes each represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/awards/oscar.html/?pn=statuette|title= Oscar Statuette: Legacy|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MGM]]'s art director [[Cedric Gibbons]], one of the original Academy members, supervised the design of the award [[trophy]] by printing the design on a scroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url= http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2000/00.05.03.html|title= Academy to Commemorate Oscar Designer Cedric Gibbons|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|date=May 3, 2007|accessdate = April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In need of a model for his statuette Gibbons was introduced by his then wife [[Dolores del Río]] to Mexican film director and actor [[Emilio Fernández|Emilio &quot;El Indio&quot; Fernández]]. Reluctant at first, Fernández was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the &quot;Oscar&quot;. Then, sculptor [[George Stanley (sculptor)|George Stanley]] (who also did the Muse Fountain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/about/history.cfm | title=Muse Fountain}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]) sculpted Gibbons's design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92.5 percent [[tin]] and 7.5 percent copper and then gold-plated it. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway &amp; Sons Foundry in [[Batavia, Illinois]], which also contributed to casting the molds for the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] and [[Emmy Award]]s statuettes.

=== Naming ===
[[Image:Donblacknightingale.JPG|right|thumb|Lyricist [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]] shows his [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song Oscar]] for ''[[Born Free (song)|Born Free]]'' from the [[Born Free|1966 film of the same name]]]]
The root of the name ''Oscar'' is contested.  One biography of [[Bette Davis]] claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000012/bio|title= Bette Davis biography|publisher=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate = April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the earliest mentions in print of the term ''Oscar'' dates back to a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] article about the 1934 [[6th Academy Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747239,00.html | accessdate = | work=Time | title=Cinema: Oscars | date=March 26, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to Bette Davis's receipt of the award in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://firstmention.com/oscars.aspx|title= The Oscars, 1936|accessdate =February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Walt Disney]] is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932. Another claimed origin is that the Academy's Executive Secretary, [[Margaret Herrick]], first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette's reminding her of her &quot;Uncle Oscar&quot; (a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Oscar&quot; in ''The Oxford English Dictionary'', June 2008 Draft Revision.&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist [http://old.oscars.org/mhl/sc/skolsky_sidney_sc.html Sidney Skolsky] was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline, &quot;Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Emanuel (2003) ''All About Oscar: The History and Politics of the Academy Awards'' Continuum, New York. ISBN 0-8264-1452-4&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy was officially dubbed the &quot;Oscar&quot; in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscar.com/oscarhistory/?pn=statuette|title=OSCAR.com – 80th Annual Academy Awards – Oscar Statuette|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another legend reports that the Norwegian-American Eleanor Lilleberg, executive secretary to Louis B. Mayer, saw the first statuette and exclaimed, &quot;It looks like [[King Oscar II]]!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/baltzersen/baltzersen16.html In Honor of King Oscar II of Norway] by Jørn K. Baltzersen, LewRockwell.com&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the day she asked, &quot;What should we do with Oscar, put him in the vault?&quot; and the name stuck.

=== Ownership of Oscar statuettes ===

Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.&lt;ref&gt;(Levy 2003, pg 28)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Oscar is under the ownership of the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

    }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The case of [[Mike Todd|Michael Todd]]'s grandson trying to sell Todd's Oscar statuette illustrates that there are some who do not agree with this idea. When Todd's grandson attempted to sell Todd's Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector, the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction. Although Oscar sales transactions have been successful, some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.&lt;ref&gt;(Levy 2003, pg 29)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomination ==

Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January. Prior to 2004, nomination results were announced publicly in early February.

=== Voters ===

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,835 as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Sandy Cohen | title=Academy Sets Oscars Contingency Plan | url=http://news.aol.com/entertainment/story/_a/oscars-contingency-plan/20080130161309990001 | work=AOL News | date=January 30, 2008 | accessdate=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (and its predecessor [[Price Waterhouse]]) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm|title = The men who are counting on Oscar|publisher=BBC News|author=Jackie Finlay|date=March 3, 2006|accessdate =April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.

New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2007/07.06.18.html|title = Academy Invites 115 to Become Members|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = September 4, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070827031611/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2007/07.06.18.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = August 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rules ===

Currently, according to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of January 1 to midnight at the end of December 31, in [[Los Angeles County, California]], to qualify (except for the Best Foreign Language Film).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
   |url        = http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule02.html
   |title      = Rule Two: Eligibility
   |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
   |accessdate = April 13, 2007
    }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 2010 Best Picture winner, ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', was actually first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the [[81st Academy Awards|2009 awards]] as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the [[82nd Academy Awards|2010 awards]].

Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40 minutes, except for short subject awards, and it must exist either on a [[35 mm film|35 mm]] or [[70 mm film]] print or in 24&amp;nbsp;frame/s or 48&amp;nbsp;frame/s [[progressive scan]] [[digital cinema]] format with native resolution not less than [[720p|1280x720]].

Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.

In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc.); there are some exceptions though in the case of certain categories, like Foreign Film, Documentary and Animated Feature Film in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches. In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category. Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can only submit one film per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

   |title      = The Academy and its Oscar Awards – Reminder List of Eligible Releases
   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the various branches nominate those in their respective fields while all members may submit nominees for Best Picture. The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories, including Best Picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Ceremony ==
=== Telecast ===

[[Image:31st Acad Awards.jpg|thumb|300px|31st Academy Awards Presentations, [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theater]], Hollywood, 1959]]
[[Image:81st Academy Awards Ceremony.JPG|thumb|300px|81st Academy Awards Presentations, [[Hollywood and Highland]], Hollywood, 2009]]

The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, most commonly in February or March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast).

The Academy Awards is televised live across the United States (excluding [[Alaska]] and Hawaii), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oscar.com/oscarnight/?pn=internationalbroadcasters|title=International Broadcasters from Oscars.com|publisher=Oscars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nielsen.com/media/2008/pr_080221a.html Nielsen – Press Release: The Nielsen Company's 2008 Guide to the Academy Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards ceremonies (such as the Emmys, Golden Globes, and [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]) are broadcast live in the East Coast but are on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]] in the West Coast and might not air on the same day outside North America (if the awards are even televised). The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources.
The Awards show was first televised on [[NBC]] in 1953. NBC continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Network took over, televising the festivities through 1970, after which NBC resumed the broadcasts. ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976; it is under contract to do so through the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release

    }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After more than sixty years of being held in late March or early April, the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with Oscar season in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. (Some years, the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the Winter Olympics.) Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most [[Emmys]] in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

After many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00 p.m. Eastern/6:00 p.m Pacific, in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30 p.m. Eastern/5:30 p.m. Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

    }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19980701&amp;id=-CsiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eqYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6637,43314 Academy Awards will move to Sunday night] Reading Eagle – July 1, 1998; From ''Google News Archive''&lt;/ref&gt; For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&amp;dat=19990319&amp;id=sKEiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=laoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1224,4570799 Never Say Never: Academy Awards move to Sunday] The Item – March 19, 1999; From ''Google News Archive''&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 1981, the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after [[Reagan assassination attempt|the shooting]] of President [[Ronald Reagan]] and others in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]].

In 1993, an ''In Memoriam'' segment was introduced,&lt;ref name=&quot;fawcett&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/mar/10/oscars-farrah-fawcett|title=Farrah Fawcett:Oscars director apologises for 'In Memoriam' omission|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=March 8, 2010 | location=London | first=Ben | last=Child}}&lt;/ref&gt; honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Sandy|last=Cohen|title=Oscar's 'In Memoriam' segment is touching to watch, painful to make |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2010-03-03-oscar-memorial-segment_N.htm|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=USA Today |date=March 3, 2010|accessdate=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names.

In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners' acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds. This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed &quot;the single most hated thing on the show&quot; – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/feb/16/oscar-winners-speeches-cut | accessdate = | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Cut … all change at Oscars as winners are given just 45 seconds to say thanks | first=Sam | last=Jones | date=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy has also had recent discussions about moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. But such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers. Also, a January ceremony may have to compete with [[National Football League]] playoff games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Historically, the &quot;Oscarcast&quot; has pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy. More than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the [[70th Academy Awards]] in 1998, the year of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', which generated close to US$600 million at the North American box office pre-Oscars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=Academy's red carpet big stage for advertisers | first=Meg | last=James | date=February 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[76th Academy Awards]] ceremony in which ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture drew 43.56 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday_oscar&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2005-01-26-oscar-telecast_x.htm|work=USA Today |title=Oscars lack blockbuster to lure TV viewers | date=January 26, 2005 | first=Scott | last=Bowles | accessdate=November 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most watched ceremony based on [[Nielsen ratings]] to date, however, was the [[42nd Academy Awards]] (Best Picture ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'') which drew a 43.4% household rating on April 7, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime Charts and Data: Top 100 TV Shows of All Time by ''Variety'']&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings. The [[78th Academy Awards]] which awarded low-budgeted, independent film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-03-07-nielsen-analysis_x.htm | title=Low Ratings ''Crash'' Party |work=USA Today | first=Gary | last=Levin | date=March 7, 2006 | accessdate=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the [[80th Academy Awards]] telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080227/LIFE/802270307 | title=Oscar ratings worst ever |work=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another low-budget, independently financed film (''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'').

== Venues ==

In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]].  From 1930–1943, the awards were presented first at [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|the Ambassador Hotel]] in Hollywood. Then the Oscar ceremonies were held at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] in downtown Los Angeles from 1930 to 1943.

[[Grauman's Chinese Theater]] in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The [[21st Academy Awards]] in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theater at what was the Academy's headquarters on [[Melrose Avenue]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's Pantages Theatre.  With the advent of television, the 1953–1957 awards took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York first at the NBC International Theatre (1953) and then at the NBC Century Theatre (1954–1957), after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles.  The Oscars moved to the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles, this time to the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] at the [[Los Angeles Music Center|Los Angeles County Music Center]].

In 2002, Hollywood's [[Kodak Theatre]] became the permanent home of the award ceremonies.

In the first year of the awards, the Best Director award was split into two separate categories (Drama and Comedy).  At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical).  From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction, Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two separate categories (black-and-white films and color films).

Another award, entitled the [[Academy Award for Best Original Musical]], is still in the Academy rulebooks and has yet to be retired.  However, due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year, it has not been awarded since 1984 (when ''[[Purple Rain]]'' won).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule16.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the &quot;[[Oscar season]].&quot;  This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality.  [[William Friedkin]], an Oscar-winning film director and producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009. He described it as &quot;the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video |people=Friedkin, William (Director) |date=February 24, 2009|title=Director William Friedkin at the Hudson Union Society |url=http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |accessdate=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was [[Dudley Nichols]] (Best Writing in 1935 for ''[[The Informer (1935 film)|The Informer]]''). Nichols boycotted the [[8th Academy Awards|Eighth Academy Awards]] ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writer's Guild.&lt;ref name=DYK&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp|title=The Oscars Did You Know?|accessdate=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George C. Scott]] became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]''), at the [[43rd Academy Awards]] ceremony. Scott explained, &quot;The whole thing is a goddamn meat parade. I don't want any part of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm | accessdate = |publisher=BBC News | title=George C Scott: The man who refused an Oscar | date=September 23, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904789,00.html | accessdate = | work=Time | title=Show Business: Meat Parade | date=March 8, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp |title=Fast Facts – Did You Know? |publisher=Biography.com |date=May 16, 1929 |accessdate=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third winner, [[Marlon Brando]], refused his award (Best Actor in 1972 for ''[[The Godfather]]''), citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans.  At the [[45th Academy Awards]] ceremony, Brando sent [[Sacheen Littlefeather]] to read a 15-page speech detailing Brando's criticisms.&lt;ref name=DYK/&gt;

It has been observed that several of the Academy Award winners – particularly Best Picture – have not stood the test of time nor defeated worthier efforts. Tim Dirks, editor of [[American Movie Classics|AMC's]] [[filmsite.org]], has written of the Academy Awards,

{{quote|Unfortunately, the critical worth, artistic vision, cultural influence, and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight. Especially since the 80s, moneymaking 'formula-made' blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd-pleasing titans (and Best Picture winners), but they haven't necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html |title=Academy Awards – The Oscars |accessdate=October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Best Picture is not the only category to come under criticism.  In his review of ''[[The Lives of Others]]'', Nick Davis argued,

{{quote|Generally speaking, if you drop the adjective &quot;Best&quot; and replace it with &quot;Most,&quot; you come to a better understanding of what the Academy Awards are often about. &quot;Most Editing&quot; would be an apt label for the kinds of movies that win trophies for being so obviously &quot;edited,&quot; particularly through action scenes or across multiple plot-strands, that even audiences who rarely think about film editing sit up and take notice. &quot;Most Sound&quot; and &quot;Most Sound Effects&quot; would explain the lingering fascination with explosions and submarine pings rather than subtler work connected to mood or character, and &quot;Most Visual Effects&quot; is even more self-explanatory. &quot;Most Original Score&quot; works if we parse &quot;Most&quot; not onto &quot;Original&quot; but onto &quot;Score,&quot; since the compositions possessed of the greatest uniqueness and creativity rarely win or even get nominated, but movies crammed with music often do, even when the winning composer wrote almost none of it (see: ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]''). Actors are often rewarded for doing the Most Acting, especially in the Supporting divisions, since &quot;Most&quot; connotes both the fussiness of one's thesping (just ask [[Renée Zellweger]] and [[Tim Robbins]]) and the awful-lotta screen time that nominees like [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Cate Blanchett]], and [[Natalie Portman]] tend to have over truly &quot;supporting&quot; actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nicksflickpicks.com/livsothr.html |title=Nick's Flick Picks review of The Lives of Others |accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Taylor,+Elizabeth |title=Taylor, Elizabeth |accessdate=October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; personal popularity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://incontention.com/?p=1045 |title=What’s the worst Best Actor choice of all time? |accessdate=October 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; atonement for past mistakes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/files/2009/02/being-a-member.html |title=Being an Oscar voter *doesn't* mean never having to say you're sorry |accessdate=October 4, 2009 | work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; or presented as a &quot;career honor&quot; to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dH2Lb_YhIhAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA268&amp;lpg=RA1-PA268&amp;dq=Career+Oscars+particular+performance+for+which+an+artist+wins+serves+as+a+vehicle+to+reward+a+body+of+stellar+work.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z66G4aRx_x&amp;sig=n7s7nSeAK1g6cKQJeWuIF4gaCH8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t3HISvriKoXWsgOypMWiBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=All about Oscar: the history and politics of the Academy Awards – The Career Oscars |accessdate=October 4, 2009 | isbn=978-0-8264-1452-6 | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The 25th Independent Spirit Awards (in 2010), usually held in Santa Monica the Saturday before the Oscars, marked the first time it was moved to a Friday and a change of venue to L.A. Live, the newly built entertainment complex developed in Downtown Los Angeles.
* The 8th annual &quot;Night Before,&quot; traditionally held at The Beverly Hills hotel (8 years running in 2010) and generally known as ''THE'' party of the season, benefits the [[Motion Picture and Television Fund]], which operates a retirement home for SAG actors in the [[San Fernando Valley]].
* Elton John's AIDS fundraiser viewing party airs the awards live at the nearby Pacific Design Center.
* The Governors' Ball is the Academy's official after-party, including dinner, and is held adjacent to the awards-presentation venue.
* The Vanity Fair after-party, historically held at the former Morton's restaurant, is now for the 2nd year at the Sunset Towers.

'''''Actrius''''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Actresses'') is a [[1996 in film|1996 film]] directed by [[Ventura Pons]]. In the film, there are no male actors and the four leading actresses dubbed themselves in the Castilian version.

==Synopsis==
In order to prepare the role of an important old actress, a theatre student interviews three actresses who were her pupils: an international diva (Glòria Marc, played by [[Núria Espert]]), a television star (Assumpta Roca, played by [[Rosa Maria Sardà]]) and a dubbing director (Maria Caminal, played by [[Anna Lizaran]]).

''Animalia'' is an [[alliteration|alliterative]] [[alphabet]] book and contains twenty-six illustrations, one for each letter of the alphabet.  Each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom (A is for [[alligator]], B is for [[butterfly]], etc.) along with a short poem utilizing the letter of the page for many of the words.  The illustrations contain many other objects beginning with that letter that the reader can try to identify. As an additional challenge, the author has hidden a picture of himself as a child in every picture. In 1987, ''Animalia'' won the title of Honour Book in the [[Children's Book Council of Australia]] Picture Book of the Year Awards.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In 1996, a tenth anniversary edition was released.

Base also published a [[colouring book]] version for children to do their own colouring.

A [[Animalia (TV series)|television series]] was also created, based on the book, which airs in the United States, Australia, Canada, the UK, and Norway. It also airs on Minimax for the Czech and Slovak Republics.

Graeme Base also created a series of riddles relating to hidden objects within each of the illustrations written especially for the wall frieze. 

In 2010, The Base Factory and AppBooks released Animalia as an application for iPad.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''International Atomic Time''' ('''TAI''', from the [[French language|French]] name '''Temps Atomique International''') is a high-precision atomic [[coordinate time|coordinate]] [[time standard]] based on the notional passage of [[proper time]] on [[Earth]]'s [[geoid]].  It is the principal realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]], and the basis for [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface. {{As of|2011|1|1}}, 00:00:00 UTC, TAI was exactly 34 seconds ahead of UTC (this is the case since 1 January 2009): an initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 24 [[leap second]]s in UTC since 1972; the last leap second was added on 31 December 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;UTC-TAI.history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/bul/bulc/UTC-TAI.history |title= Bulletin C: Relationship Between TAI and UTC | publisher= [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|IERS EOP PC]], [[Paris Observatory|Observatoire de Paris]] |accessdate=4 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Time coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both [[Julian Date]]s and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used.  TAI in this form was synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.

==Operation==
TAI as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over 200 [[atomic clock]]s in about 70 national laboratories worldwide. The clocks are compared using satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Circular T 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone (see [[signal averaging]] for a discussion). The majority of the clocks are [[caesium]] clocks; the definition of the [[SI]] second is written in terms of caesium.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp;Seidelmann 2009, 207, 214&lt;/ref&gt;

The participating institutions each broadcast, in real time, a frequency signal with [[time code]]s, which is their estimate of TAI.  Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC. These time scales are denoted in the form ''TAI(NPL)'' (''UTC(NPL)'' for the UTC form), where ''NPL'' in this case identifies the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].

The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other.  The [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible.  This combined time scale is published monthly in [ftp://ftp2.bipm.fr/pub/tai/publication/cirt/ Circular T], and is the [[canonical]] TAI.  This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC(''x'') and TAI-TA(''x''), for each participating institution ''x''.

Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T.  Aside from this, once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised.  In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale.  Doing so does not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).

==History==
Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory, UK (NPL). Early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. The &quot;Greenwich Atomic&quot; (GA) scale began in 1955 at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. The [[United States Naval Observatory]] began the A.1 scale  13 September 1956, using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the National Bureau of Standards, [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Colorado.  The [[International Time Bureau]] (BIH) began a time scale, T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of [[VLF]] radio signals. Both the BIH scale and A.1 was defined by an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] at the beginning of 1958: it was set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding [[UT2]] instant. The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: &quot;A3&quot; in 1963 and &quot;TA(BIH)&quot; in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann 2009, 199&amp;ndash;201.&lt;/ref&gt;  This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the [[astronomy|astronomical]] realisation of UT2.  At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several [[centisecond]]s.

The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967, and in 1971 it was renamed International Atomic Time (TAI).&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann 2009, 202&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1961, UTC began.  UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time, the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximated [[UT2]] until the end of 1971, and [[UT1]] thereafter.  This was a compromise arrangement for a broadcast time scale: a linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised, while approximating UT1 means that tasks such as [[navigation]] which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann 2009, 227&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to [[gravitational time dilation]], and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the [[altitude]]s of the various clocks.  Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at [[mean sea level]] (the geoid).  Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;.  The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name ''EAL'' (''Echelle Atomique Libre'', meaning ''Free Atomic Scale'').&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann, 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for [[Barycentric Coordinate Time]] (TCB), [[Geocentric Coordinate Time]] (TCG), and [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT).  All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant.  (The offset is to provide continuity with the older [[Ephemeris Time]].)  TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184&amp;nbsp;s.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Seidelmann, 218&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Belisaire demandant l'aumone Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|325px|Giving [[alms]] to the poor is often considered an altruistic action in many cultures and religions.]]

'''Altruism''' ({{Pron-en|ˈæltruːɪzəm}}) is selfless concern for the [[Quality of life|welfare]] of others. It is a traditional [[virtue]] in many cultures, and a core aspect of various religious traditions, though the concept of 'others' toward whom concern should be directed can vary among religions. Altruism is the opposite of [[selfishness]].

Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of [[loyalty]] and [[duty]]. Altruism focuses on a motivation to help others or a want to do [[good and evil|good]] without reward, while duty focuses on a moral obligation towards a specific individual (for example, a [[god]], a [[monarch|king]]), a specific organization (for example, a [[government]]), or an abstract concept (for example, [[patriotism]] etc.). Some individuals may feel both altruism and duty, while others may not. Pure altruism is giving without regard to reward or the benefits that recognition of the giving may bring. 

The term ''altruism'' may also refer to an [[altruism (ethics)|ethical doctrine]] that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is the opposite of [[ethical egoism|egoism]].

==The notion of altruism==
The concept has a long history in [[philosophical]] and [[ethical]] thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher of science]], [[Auguste Comte]], and has become a major topic for [[psychologists]] (especially [[evolutionary psychology]] researchers), [[evolutionary biologists]], and [[ethology|ethologists]]. While ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields lead to different perspectives on altruism.

==Scientific viewpoints==
====Anthropology====
[[Marcel Mauss]]'s book ''The Gift'' contains a passage &quot;Note on alms&quot;.
This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism)
from the notion of sacrifice.

&quot;Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand,
and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis
avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth
of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the
gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that
the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been
hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.&quot;

====Evolutionary explanations====
{{Main|Altruism in animals|Evolution of morality|Evolutionary ethics}}
In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.&lt;ref name=Bell2008&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers on alleged altruist behaviours among animals have been ideologically opposed to the sociological [[social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] concept of the &quot;[[survival of the fittest]]&quot;, under the name of &quot;survival of the nicest&quot;—not to be confused with the biological concept of [[Darwinism|Darwin's]] [[theory of evolution]]. Insistence on such cooperative behaviors between animals was first exposed by the Russian zoologist and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] in his 1902 book, ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]''.

Theories of apparently-altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged out of traditional evolutionary analyses, and from  [[game theory]] respectively.

Some of the proposed mechanisms are:

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]'s development of the [[Price equation]], which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides''. These protists live as individual [[amoebae]] until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body. Social behavior and altruism share many similarities to the interactions between the many parts (cells, genes) of an organism, but are distinguished by the ability of each individual to reproduce indefinitely without an absolute requirement for its neighbors.

====Neurobiology====
Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the [[National Institutes of Health]] and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. In their research, published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA in October, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Human fronto–mesolimbic networks guide decisions about charitable donation, PNAS 2006:103(42);15623-15628)&lt;/ref&gt; they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Another experiment funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] and conducted in 2007 at the [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], North Carolina suggests a different view, &quot;that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/61312.php &quot;Brain Scan Predicts Difference Between Altruistic And Selfish People&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the study published in the February 2007 print issue of [[Nature Neuroscience]], researchers have found a part of the brain that behaves differently for altruistic and selfish people.

The researchers invited 45 volunteers to play a computer game and also to watch the computer play the game. In some rounds, the game resulted in the volunteers winning money for themselves, and in others it resulted in money being donated to a charity of the volunteer's choice. During these activities, the researchers took functional magnetic resonance imaging ([[fMRI]]) scans of the participants' brains and were &quot;surprised by the results&quot;. Although they &quot;were expecting to see activity in the brain's reward centers&quot;, based on the idea that &quot;people perform altruistic acts because they feel good about it&quot;, what they found was that &quot;another part of the brain was also involved, and it was quite sensitive to the difference between doing something for personal gain and doing it for someone else's gain&quot;. That part of the brain is called the posterior superior [[temporal cortex]] (pSTC).

In the next stage, the scientists asked the participants some questions about type and frequency of their altruistic or helping behaviours. They then analysed the responses to generate an estimate of a person's tendency to act altruistically and compared each person's level of altruism against their [[fMRI]] [[brain scan]]. The results showed that pSTC activity rose in proportion to a person's self-reported level of altruism. According to the researchers, the results suggest that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it. &quot;We believe that the ability to perceive other people's actions as meaningful is critical for altruism&quot;, said lead study investigator Dharol Tankersley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/01/070121162756.htm &quot;Activation Of Brain Region Predicts Altruism&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genetics====
A study by [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] at the [[Santa Fe Institute]] in [[New Mexico]], US, is seen by some as breathing new life into the model of [[group selection]] for altruism, known as &quot;Survival of the nicest&quot;. Bowles conducted a genetic analysis of contemporary foraging groups, including [[Australian aboriginals]], native [[Siberian]] [[Inuit]] populations and indigenous tribal groups in Africa. It was found that [[hunter-gatherer]] bands of up to 30 individuals were considerably more closely related than was previously thought. Under these conditions, thought to be similar to those of the middle and upper [[Paleolithic]], altruism towards other group-members would improve the overall fitness of the group. This is however simply a form of [[inclusive fitness]] – one vehicle helping other vehicles likely to contain the same genes.

If an individual defends the group, risking death or simply reducing his reproductive fitness, genes that this individual shares with those he successfully defends (group members) would increase in frequency (thanks to his defence supporting their reproduction). If such helpful acts are rewarded with food sharing, sexual access, [[monogamy]] or other benefits, there is no average &quot;cost&quot; of altruistic behaviour to be repaid. Bowles assembled genetic, climactic, archaeological, ethnographic and experimental data to examine the cost-benefit relationship of human cooperation in ancient populations. In his model, altruism is selected for when members of a group bearing genes for altruistic behaviour pay a cost –  limiting their reproductive opportunities – but receive a benefit from sharing food and information. If their acts increase the average fitness of group members, altruism increase so long as group members tend also to maintain or increase their inter-relatedness (in-group mating). Bands of such altruistic humans could then act together not only defensively, but aggressively, to gain resources from other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Richard (7 December 2006) [http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10750.html &quot;Why altruism paid off for our ancestors&quot;] (NewScientist.com news service)&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruist theories in evolutionary biology were contested by [[Amotz Zahavi]], the inventor of the signal theory and its correlative, the [[handicap principle]], based mainly on his observations of the [[Arabian Babbler]], a bird commonly known for its surprising (alleged) altruistic behaviours.

==Religious viewpoints==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}
Most, if not all, of the world's [[religion]]s promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]] and [[Sikhism]], etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.

====Buddhism====
Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism.  Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and both are focused on all beings equally: the wish that all beings be happy (love) and the wish that all beings be free from suffering (compassion).  &quot;Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion.  These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being&quot; (Dalai Lama).&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech by the Dalai Lama&quot;&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm Speech by the Dalai Lama]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since &quot;all beings&quot; includes the individual, love and compassion in Buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other.  It is even said that the very distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering.  In practical terms, however, because of the spontaneous self-centeredness of most of us, Buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others, and thus can be characterized as &quot;altruistic.&quot;  Many would agree with the Dalai Lama that Buddhism as a religion is kindness toward others.

Still, the very notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: &quot;The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes&quot; (Dalai Lama&lt;ref name=&quot;Speech by the Dalai Lama&quot;/&gt;).

In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but on the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect.  One simple illustration of such cause and effect would be the case of experiencing the effects of what I myself cause: if I cause suffering, I will as a natural consequence experience suffering; if I cause happiness, I will as a natural consequence experience happiness.

{{Main| Karma in Buddhism}}
In Buddhism, ''karma'' (Pāli ''kamma'') is strictly distinguished from '''''[[vipaka|vipāka]]''''', meaning &quot;fruit&quot; or &quot;result&quot;. Karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause (Pāli ''hetu'') in the [[Twelve nidanas|chain]] of [[Pratitya-samutpada|cause and effect]], where it comprises the elements of &quot;volitional activities&quot; (Pali ''sankhara'') and &quot;action&quot; (Pali ''bhava''). Any action is understood to create &quot;seeds&quot; in the mind that will sprout into the appropriate result (Pāli ''vipaka'') when they meet with the right conditions. Most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one within the wheel of [[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsāra]]; others will liberate one to [[nirvana|nirvāna]].

Buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action. Motivation usually makes the difference between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, but included in the motivation is also the aspect of ignorance; so a well-intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be &quot;bad&quot; in the sense that it creates unpleasant results for the &quot;actor&quot;.

In Buddhism, karma is not the only cause of everything that happens. The commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe as taught in the early texts in five categories, known as Niyama Dhammas:&lt;ref&gt;[[Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids]], ''Buddhism.'' Reprint by Read Books, 2007, [http://books.google.com/books?id=LljcZ_LBeL0C&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Bija+Niyama&amp;lr=].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Padmasiri De Silva, ''Environmental philosophy and ethics in Buddhism.'' Macmillan, 1998, page 41. [http://books.google.com/books?id=M4T3C6ndfZIC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Bija+Niyama#PPA41,M1].&lt;/ref&gt;

* Kamma Niyama  — Consequences of one's actions
* Utu Niyama  — Seasonal changes and climate
* Biija Niyama  — Laws of heredity
* Citta Niyama — Will of mind
* Dhamma Niyama — Nature's tendency to produce a perfect type

====Jainism====
The fundamental principles of [[Jainism]] revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. This religion preaches the view of Ahimsa – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. Jainism considers all living things to be equal. The first Thirthankar, Rishabh introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.

Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:
# Non-violence (Ahimsa)
# Truthfulness (Satya)
# Non-stealing (Asteya)
# Celibacy (Brahmacharya)
# Non-possession or non-materialism (Aparigraha)

A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride (ego) by humility, deceit by straight-forwardness and greed by contentment.

The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become Siddha (Param-atma – &quot;highest soul&quot;). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders. The &quot;great vows&quot; (mahavrata) are prescribed for monks and &quot;limited vows&quot; (anuvrata) are prescribed for householders. In other words, the house-holders are encouraged to practice the five cardinal principles of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy and non-possessiveness with their current practical limitations while the monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.

====Christianity====
Altruism was central to the teachings of [[Jesus]] found in the [[Gospel]] especially in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. From biblical to medieval [[Christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of &quot;disinterested love,&quot; as in the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] phrase &quot;love seeks not its own interests.&quot; In his book ''Indoctrination and Self-deception'', Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propagandas and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.

Though it might seem obvious that altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus, one important and influential strand of Christianity would qualify this. [[St Thomas Aquinas]] in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', I:II Quaestio 26, Article 4 states that we should love ourselves more than our neighbour. His interpretation of the Pauline phrase is that we should seek the common good more than the private good but this is because the common good is a more desirable good for the individual. 'You should love your neighbour as yourself' from [[Leviticus]] 19 and Matthew 22 is interpreted by St Thomas as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others. He does think though, that we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbour, taken as an entirety, more than our bodily life, since the ultimate purpose of love of our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude, a more desirable thing than bodily well being. Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], in coining the word Altruism, as stated above.

Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. In 1 John 4 it is stated that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God.

[[Thomas Jay Oord]] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the good of the other, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the demands of the other undermine overall well-being.

====Islam and Sufism====
In [[Sufism]], the concept of i'thar (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; [[Islam]] considers those practicing i'thar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike the European concept there is a focus on attention to everything in existence. A constant concern for [[Allah]] results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.&lt;ref name=Neusner2005&gt;{{Cite book

This concept was emphasized by Sufi mystics like [[Rabia al-Adawiyya]] who paid attention to the difference in dedication to Allah and dedication to people. 13th century Turkish sufi poet [[Yunus Emre]] explained this philosophy as &quot;Yaratılanı severiz, Yaratandan ötürü&quot; or &quot;We love the creature, because of The Creator&quot;.
====Judaism====
Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kook | first = Abraham Isaac | authorlink = | coauthors = Ben Zion Bokser | title = Abraham Isaac Kook: The lights of penitence, The moral principles, Lights of holiness, essays, letters, and poems | publisher = Paulist Press | year = 1978 | location = | pages = 135–136 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 9780809121595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is defined as [[bestowal]], or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or [[God]]. [[Kabbalah]] defines [[God]] as the force of giving in [[existence]]. Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of [[God]] was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Luzzatto | first = Moshe Ḥayyim | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The way of God | publisher = Feldheim Publishers | year = 1997 | location = | pages = 37–38 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 9780873067690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ashlag | first = Yehuda | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Building the Future Society | publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers | year = 2006 | location = Thornhill, Canada | pages = 120–130 | url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main | doi = | id = | isbn = 9657065348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ashlag | first = Yehuda | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Building the Future Society | publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers | year = 2006 | location = Thornhill, Canada | pages = 175–180 | url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main | doi = | id = | isbn = 9657065348 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sikhism====
Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. In the late 17th century, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] Ji (the tenth [[guru]] in Sikhism), was in war with the [[Moghul]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths, when a fellow Sikh, [[Bhai Kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy. He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield.
&quot;What were you doing, and why?&quot; asked the Guru. &quot;I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them,&quot; replied Bhai Kanhaiya.
The Guru responded, &quot;Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru.&quot;

It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vedanta====
[[Vedanta]] differs from the view that karma is a law of cause and effect but instead additionally hold that karma is mediated by the will of a personal supreme god. This view of karma is in contradiction to [[Buddhism]], [[Jain]] and other [[Hindu religion]]s that do view karma as a law of cause and effect.

[[Swami Sivananda]], an [[Advaita]] scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the [[Brahma Sutras]], a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[punya]], which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda, Swami. ''Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8'', Sutras 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thank you. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The following sources identify Rand as a philosopher:

She is known for her two best-selling novels and for developing a philosophical system she called [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].
&lt;!-- Biographical details --&gt;
Born and educated in Russia, Rand migrated to the United States in 1926. She worked as a screenwriter in [[Hollywood]] and had a play produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1935–1936. She first achieved fame with her 1943 novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]''. Over a decade later, she published her ''magnum opus'', the philosophical novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', in 1957.

&lt;!-- Philosophical views --&gt;
Rand's political views, reflected in both her fiction and nonfiction work, emphasize [[individual rights]] (including property rights) and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]], enforced by a constitutionally [[limited government]]. She was a fierce opponent of all forms of [[collectivism]] and [[statism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;onlypath&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=The Only Path to Tomorrow |journal=[[Reader's Digest]] |month=January |year=1944 |volume=44 |issue=261 |pages=88–90 |url=http://fare.tunes.org/liberty/library/toptt.html}} Reprinted in{{cite book |first=Ayn |last=Rand |title=The Ayn Rand Column |publisher=Second Renaissance Books |location=Oceanside, California |year=1991 |isbn=1-56114-099-6 |oclc=26061978 |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Schwartz |editor-link=Peter Schwartz (writer) |pages=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Racism&quot; in {{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[fascism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], and the [[welfare state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]] |chapter=&quot;Extremism,&quot; or The Art of Smearing |page=180 |isbn=0-451-14795-2 |year=1967 |location=New York |publisher=Signet |oclc=24916193 |last=Rand |first=Ayn}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoted [[ethical egoism]] while rejecting the [[Altruism (ethics)|ethic of altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Introduction&quot; in {{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; She considered [[reason]] to be the only means of acquiring [[knowledge]] and its advocacy the most important aspect of her philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution]] |chapter=The Left: Old and New |page=62 |isbn=0-452-01184-1 |oclc=39281836 |year=1999 |location=New York |publisher=Meridian |last=Rand |first=Ayn |others=Edited by Peter Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating, &quot;I am not ''primarily'' an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not ''primarily'' an advocate of egoism, but of reason.

==Life and work==
===Early life===
Rand was born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum ({{lang-ru|Алиса Зиновьевна Розенбаум}}) on February 2, 1905, to a [[bourgeois]] family living in [[Saint Petersburg]]. She was the eldest of the three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and Anna Borisovna Rosenbaum, largely non-observant [[Jews]]. Her younger sisters were Natasha and Nora. Rand's father was educated at [[Warsaw University]] as a [[chemist]] and became a successful pharmacist, eventually owning his own pharmacy and the building in which it was located.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=3–5}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=2–3}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His success allowed the family to employ a cook, maid, nurse, and [[governess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up, she was praised by adults for her intelligence, but her intensity and social awkwardness meant she rarely had friends her own age. On one occasion, when a school assignment called for her to write about the joys of childhood, she instead wrote what she later recalled as &quot;a scathing denunciation&quot; of childhood as inferior to the intellectual condition of adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=11–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand was twelve at the time of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], during which Rand's sympathies were with [[Alexander Kerensky]]. Rand's family life was disrupted by the rise of the [[Bolshevik]] party under [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Her father's pharmacy was confiscated by the Bolsheviks, and the family fled to the [[Crimea]], which was initially under the control of the [[White Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. She later recalled that while in high school she determined that she was an [[atheist]] and that she valued reason above any other human attribute. After graduating from high school in the Crimea, at sixteen Rand returned with her family to Saint Petersburg, where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion, nearly starving.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=14–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Twelvecollegia.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black-and-white engraving shows a large building along the bank of a river, with numerous people and carriages nearby|Rand completed a three-year program at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Petrograd State University]].]]

===University education===

After the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, including Jews, allowing Rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at [[Saint Petersburg State University|Petrograd State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she studied in the department of [[social pedagogy]], majoring in history.&lt;ref name=Sciabarra&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sciabarra |first=Chris Matthew |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/randt2.htm |title=The Rand Transcript |journal=[[The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=1999 |month=Fall |pages=1–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the university she was introduced to the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]], who would form two of the greatest influences and counter-influences respectively on her thought.&lt;ref name=Sciabarra/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=451–460}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17–18, 22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Able to read French, German and Russian, at this time she also discovered the fiction writers [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Edmond Rostand]], and [[Friedrich Schiller]], who became her perennial favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=17, 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with many other &quot;bourgeois&quot; students, Rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating. However, after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Rand did in October 1924.&lt;ref name=Sciabarra/&gt; She subsequently studied for a year at the State [[Technicum]] for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For one of her assignments, she wrote an essay about the actress [[Pola Negri]], which became her first published work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heller49-50&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be ''Rand'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly as a [[Cyrillic]] [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of her birth surname,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_ayn_rand_faq_index2#ar_q3b |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Ayn Rand: What is the origin of “Rand”? |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she adopted the first name ''Ayn'', either from a Finnish name or from the Hebrew word {{lang|he| עין}} (''ayin'', meaning &quot;eye&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Rand said the origin of ''Ayn'' was Finnish {{harv|Rand|1995|p=40}}, but some biographical sources question this, suggesting it may come from a Hebrew nickname. {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=55–57}} provides a detailed discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===

In fall 1925, she was granted a [[Visa (document)|visa]] to visit American relatives. As her train pulled away she called out to her family, &quot;By the time I return, I'll be famous!&quot; Leaving Russia on January 17, 1926, Rand arrived in the United States on February 19, entering by ship through [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=50–53}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was so impressed with the skyline of [[Manhattan]] upon her arrival that she cried what she later called &quot;tears of splendor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with relatives in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free. She then set out for [[Hollywood, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, she struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses. A chance meeting with famed director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] led to a job as an [[extra (drama)|extra]] in his film, ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'', and to subsequent work as a junior screenwriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working on ''The King of Kings'', she intentionally bumped into an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor, who caught her eye. The two were married on April 15, 1929. Rand [[United States nationality law#Naturalization|became an American citizen]] in 1931. Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, Rand worked for a time as the head of the costume department at [[RKO]] Studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=35–40}}; {{harvnb|Paxton|1998|pp=74, 81, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to get permission to emigrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=96–98}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=43–44, 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early fiction===
{{See also|Night of January 16th|We the Living|Anthem (novella)}}

In the late 1920s, Rand worked on a number of writing projects, including movie scenarios, short stories, and a novel called ''The Little Street''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|pp=3, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In notes for the novel that Rand scholars have interpreted as evidence of a qualified admiration for the ideas of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|pp=21}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=24–25}};{{cite journal |title=A Renaissance in Rand Scholarship |last=Sciabarra |first=Chris Matthew |authorlink=Chris Matthew Sciabarra |journal=Reason Papers |volume=23 |month=Fall |year=1998 |pages=132–159 |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/rprev.htm}};{{cite journal |title=Ronald E. Merrill and the Discovery of Ayn Rand's Nietzschean Period |last=Reed |first=Adam |journal=[[The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]] |volume=10 |month=Spring |year=2009 |pages=325–326 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the hero of ''The Little Street'' was described as having &quot;the true, innate psychology of a Superman&quot; and was to be based on the case of child killer [[William Edward Hickman]], who Rand described as &quot;a brilliant, unusual, exceptional boy turned into a purposeless monster&quot; by a society that then turned on him as a mob, not because of his crime but because of &quot;his immense, explicit egoism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|pp=27–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand later abandoned both the novel and her positive view of Nietzsche, and most of these early projects were never produced or published during Rand's lifetime.

Rand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay ''[[Red Pawn]]'' to [[Universal Studios]] in 1932. [[Josef Von Sternberg]] considered it for [[Marlene Dietrich]], but [[anti-Communist]] themes were unpopular at the time, and the project came to nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=40, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the courtroom drama ''[[Night of January 16th]]'', first produced in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in 1935. Each night the &quot;jury&quot; was selected from members of the audience, and one of the two different endings, depending on the jury's &quot;verdict&quot;, would then be performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1971|pp=3–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, [[Paramount Pictures]] produced a movie version of the play. Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fountainheads: Wright, Rand, the FBI and Hollywood |last=Johnson |first=Donald Leslie |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |year=2005 |isbn=0-7864-1958-X |oclc=56617298 |pages=55–56}} ''cf''. {{harvnb|Rand|1971|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first novel, the semi-autobiographical ''[[We the Living]]'', was published in 1936. Set in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. In the foreword to the novel, Rand stated that ''We the Living'' &quot;is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |chapter=Foreword |title=We The Living |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |page=xviii |isbn=0-525-94054-5 |oclc=32780458 |edition=60th Anniversary |year=1995 |origyear=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without Rand's knowledge or permission, ''We the Living'' was made into a pair of [[Italy|Italian]] films, ''Noi vivi'' and ''Addio, Kira'', in 1942. Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as ''We the Living'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her novella ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' was published in England in 1938 and in America seven years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It presents a vision of a [[dystopian]] future world in which [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s, Rand became involved in political activism. Both she and her husband worked full time in volunteer positions for the 1940 Presidential campaign of Republican [[Wendell Willkie]]. This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences, including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had just viewed pro-Willkie newsreels, an experience she greatly enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist [[Henry Hazlitt]] and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her. Once von Mises referred to Rand as &quot;the most courageous man in America,&quot; a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said &quot;man&quot; instead of &quot;woman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=114}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=249}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of ''Atlas Shrugged'', Mises invited Rand to participate in his economics seminar as his &quot;honored guest,&quot; which she did.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand also developed a friendship with [[libertarian]] writer [[Isabel Paterson]]. Rand questioned the well-informed Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book, ''[[The God of the Machine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=75–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand's first major success as a writer came with ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' in 1943, a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=61–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel centers on an uncompromising young [[architect]] named [[Howard Roark]] and his struggle against what Rand described as &quot;second-handers&quot;—those who attempt to live through others, placing others above self. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]] on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=58–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the [[amphetamine]] [[Benzedrine]] to fight fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel, but when the book was done, she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her continued use of the drug for a number of years may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=178}}; {{harvnb|Heller|pp=304–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Fountainhead'' eventually became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[Ayn Rand Institute]], by April 2008 the novel had sold over 6.5&amp;nbsp;million copies.{{cite web |title=Sales of Ayn Rand Books Reach 25&amp;nbsp;million Copies |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=17345 |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=July 31, 2009 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Rand sold the rights for a [[The Fountainhead (film)|film version]] to [[Warner Brothers]], and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer [[Hal Wallis]] as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated [[Love Letters (1945 film)|''Love Letters'']] and ''[[You Came Along]]'', along with research for a screenplay based on the development of the [[Nuclear Weapon|atomic bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|pp=68–80}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=183–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; This role gave Rand time to work on other projects, including the publication of her first work of nonfiction, an essay titled &quot;The Only Path to Tomorrow&quot;, in the January 1944 edition of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;onlypath&quot;/&gt; Rand also outlined and took extensive notes for a nonfiction treatment of her philosophy, although the planned book was never completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|pp=243–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working in Hollywood, Rand extended her involvement with [[free-market]] and [[anti-Communist]] activism. She and her husband purchased a [[Von Sternberg House|house]] designed by modernist [[Richard Neutra]] and an adjoining ranch. There, Rand entertained figures such as Hazlitt, [[Morrie Ryskind]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], [[Janet Gaynor]], [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]], [[Albert Mannheimer]] and [[Leonard Read]]. A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments that Rand saw as rude to valued political allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=130–131}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=214–215}}; {{harvnb|Rand|1997|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their break, Rand continued to promote Paterson's ''The God of the Machine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Ayn Rand's testimony before the House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities}}
Rand became involved with the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]], a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=100, 123}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also joined the anti-Communist [[American Writers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, during the [[Second Red Scare]], Rand testified as a &quot;friendly witness&quot; before the United States [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the [[Soviet Union]] and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film ''[[Song of Russia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005|pp=91–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.capmag.com/article.asp?ID=12 Ayn Rand's HUAC Testimony]&quot; in {{harvnb|Mayhew|2005|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations after the hearings, Rand described the process as &quot;futile&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayhew|2005|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several delays, the movie version of ''The Fountainhead'' was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she &quot;disliked the movie from beginning to end,&quot; complaining about its editing, acting and other elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publication of ''The Fountainhead'', Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom it had profoundly influenced. In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated &quot;The Collective&quot;) included future Federal Reserve chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later [[Nathaniel Branden]]) and his wife [[Barbara Branden|Barbara]], and Barbara's cousin [[Leonard Peikoff]]. At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, ''Atlas Shrugged'', as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's close relationship with the much younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=256–264, 331–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Atlas Shrugged'', published in 1957, was Rand's ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|p=704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand described the theme of the novel as &quot;the role of the mind in man's existence—and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=For the New Intellectual |location=New York |publisher=Signet |year=1963 |origyear=1961 |isbn=0-451-16308-7 |oclc=36698277 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a [[dystopia]]n United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists and artists go on [[strike action|strike]] and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, [[John Galt]], describes the strike as &quot;stopping the motor of the world&quot; by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]] and science fiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it contains Rand's most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction, a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt. ''Atlas Shrugged'' became an international bestseller, and in an interview with [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]] Rand declared herself &quot;the most creative thinker alive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's last work of fiction, it marked a turning point in her life, ending her career as novelist and beginning her role as a popular philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged: A Philosophical and Literary Companion |editor-last=Younkins |editor-first=Edward W. |location=Burlington, Vermont |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7546-5533-6 |oclc=69792104 |chapter=Introduction |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the novel of more than one thousand pages, however, Rand fell into a severe depression that may have been aggravated by her use of prescription amphetamines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=178}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=303–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the [[Nathaniel Branden Institute]] (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for [[Objectivist periodicals]] that she edited. Rand later published some of these articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the entire [[Objectivist movement]] as a [[cult]] or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=105–106}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, including literature, music, sexuality, even facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked all her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|pp=237–238}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=329}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2007|p=235}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks, for example at [[Yale University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=315–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received an honorary doctorate from [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also began delivering annual lectures at the [[Ford Hall Forum]], responding afterwards in her famously spirited form to questions from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these speeches and Q&amp;A sessions, she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day. These included supporting abortion rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposing the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Conscription|military draft]] (but condemning many [[draft dodgers]] as &quot;bums&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|2005|pp=89–91}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=265}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting [[Israel]] in the [[Arab-Israeli War of 1973]] as &quot;civilized men fighting savages&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|2005|p=96}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]] had the right to take land from [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|2005|pp=102–104}}; {{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=266}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt; and calling [[homosexuality]] &quot;immoral&quot; and &quot;disgusting&quot;, while also advocating the repeal of all laws against homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|2009|p=362}}; {{cite book |title=Ayn Rand, Homosexuality, and Human Liberation |last=Sciabarra |first=Chris Matthew |location=Cape Town, South Africa |publisher=Leap Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=0-958-4573-3-6 |pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also endorsed several [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates for President of the United States, most strongly [[Barry Goldwater]] in [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for ''The Objectivist Newsletter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=204–206}}; {{harvnb|Heller|2009|pp=322–323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott, whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens, which led to the closure of NBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=344–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand published an article in ''The Objectivist'' repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other &quot;irrational behavior in his private life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=To Whom It May Concern |journal=[[The Objectivist]] |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=1–8 |location=New York |year=1968 |month=May}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branden later apologized in an interview to &quot;every student of Objectivism&quot; for &quot;perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique&quot; and for &quot;contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Break Free!

A heavy smoker, Rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974. Although she had long opposed government assistance programs, she wrote that it is perfectly moral to accept [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], given the coercion used to collect the resources for such programs and the widespread impoverishment that results.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, &quot;The Question of Scholarships,&quot; ''The Objectivist'', June, 1966, reprinted as chapter 7 of ''The Voice of Reason: Essays in Objectivist Thought'', L.

She had also planned to write another novel, but did not get far in her notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|p=697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand died of [[heart failure]] on March 6, 1982 at her home in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saxon|1982|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was interred in the [[Kensico Cemetery]], [[Valhalla, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|851|accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including Alan Greenspan. A six-foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|p=403}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her will, Rand named [[Leonard Peikoff]] the heir to her estate.{{-}}

==Philosophy==
{{Objectivist movement}}{{Main|Objectivism (Ayn Rand)}}
Rand developed an integrated philosophical system called &quot;[[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].&quot; Its essence is &quot;the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;About the Author&quot; in {{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–1171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an [[atheist]] who rejected [[faith]] as antithetical to reason, Rand embraced [[philosophical realism]] and opposed all forms of what she regarded as mysticism and [[supernaturalism]], including every organized religion.&lt;ref&gt;Den Uyl, Douglas J. &amp; Rasmussen, Douglas B. &quot;Ayn Rand's Realism&quot; in {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1986|pp=3–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand argued for [[rational egoism]] (rational self-interest), as the only proper guiding moral principle. The individual should &quot;exist for his own sake,&quot; she wrote in 1962, &quot;neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Voice of Reason]] |first=Ayn |last=Rand |others=Edited by Leonard Peikoff |location=New York |publisher=New American Library |year=1989 |isbn=0-453-00634-5 |oclc=18048955 |chapter=Introducing Objectivism |page=3}} This article originally appeared in the ''Los Angeles Times'' on June 17, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand held that ''laissez-faire'', free market capitalism is the only moral social system. Her political views were strongly [[individualism|individualist]], [[anti-statist]], [[anti-fascist]] and [[anti-Communist]]. Rand was strongly opposed to many [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]], [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Libertarian movement|libertarian]] politicians of her time, including prominent anti-Communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Toffler |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Toffler |title=Playboy Interview: Ayn Rand |work=[[Playboy]] |month=March |year=1964 |volume=11 |issue=3 |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/ayn-rand-playboy-interview/index.html |pages=35–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Maureen Dowd |first=Maureen |last=Dowd |title=Where 'Atlas Shrugged' Is Still Read - Forthrightly |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/weekinreview/where-atlas-shrugged-is-still-read-forthrightly.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times  |date=September 13, 1987 |page=E5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand rejected [[anarcho-capitalism]] as &quot;a contradiction in terms&quot;, a point on which she has been criticized by self-styled &quot;anarchist Objectivists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Machan |editor1-first=Tibor |editor1-link=Tibor R.

Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and [[Douglas B.

==Reception==
During Rand's lifetime, her work evoked extremes of both praise and condemnation. Rand's first novel, ''We the Living'', was admired by the literary critic [[H.L. Mencken]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1995|pp=10, 13-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; her Broadway play ''Night of January 16th'' was both a critical and popular success,&lt;ref name=&quot;Branden 122-124&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1986|pp=122–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Fountainhead'' was hailed by a reviewer in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as &quot;masterful&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pruette&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |ref=harv |first=Lorine |last=Pruette |work=The New York Times |date=May 16, 1943 |title=Battle Against Evil |page=BR7 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20610FD3D5C167B93C4A8178ED85F478485F9}} Reprinted in {{Cite book |title=Books of the Century |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=McGrath |year=1998 |location=New York |publisher=Times Books |isbn=0-8129-2965-9 |pages=135–136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rand's novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as long and melodramatic,&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladstein 117-119&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|pp=117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they became [[bestsellers]] largely due to word of mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paxton|1998|p=120}}; {{harvnb|Britting|2004|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reviews Rand received were for ''Night of January 16th''. Reviews of the production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Branden 122-124&quot;/&gt; Rand believed that her first novel, ''We the Living'', was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says &quot;it was the most reviewed of any of her works,&quot; with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications.

Rand's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had.

During Rand's lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars.&lt;ref name=reception/&gt; When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand &quot;a treacherous undertaking&quot; that could lead to &quot;guilt by association&quot; for taking her seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=With Charity Toward None: An Analysis of Ayn Rand's Philosophy |last=O'Neill |first=William F. |location=New York |publisher=Littlefield, Adams &amp; Company |year=1977 |origyear=1971 |isbn=0-8226-0179-6 |oclc=133489 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals prior to her death in 1982, many of them in ''[[The Personalist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was &quot;On the Randian Argument&quot; by respected libertarian philosopher [[Robert Nozick]], who argued that her [[meta-ethical]] argument is unsound and fails to solve the [[is–ought problem]] posed by [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the Randian Argument |last=Nozick |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Nozick |journal=[[The Personalist]] |year=1971 |month=Spring |volume=52 |pages=282–304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in ''The Personalist'' arguing that Nozick simply misstated Rand's case.&lt;ref&gt;These included{{cite journal |title=Nozick and Rand on Property Rights |last=Machan |first=Tibor |authorlink=Tibor R.

The [[financial crisis of 2007–2011]] spurred renewed interest in her works, especially ''Atlas Shrugged'', which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=283–284}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2009|pp=51–52}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opinion articles compared real-world events with the plot of the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=125}}; {{harvnb|Doherty|2009|pp=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero [[John Galt]] appeared at [[Tea Party protests]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doherty|2009|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Cato Institute's [[Will Wilkinson]] quipped that &quot;going Galt&quot; had become the &quot;libertarian-conservative's version of progressives threatening to move to Canada.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MJones&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://motherjones.com/print/24733 |title=And the Rand Played On |first=Amy |last=Benfer |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |month=July/August |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period there was also increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the [[political left]], with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of [[Rational egoism|selfishness]] and [[free markets]], particularly through her influence on [[Alan Greenspan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' remarked that &quot;Rand's particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy, the talented, and the powerful as the oppressed&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;MJones&quot; /&gt; while ''[[The Nation]]'' alleged similarities between the &quot;moral syntax of Randianism&quot; and [[fascism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nation&quot; /&gt;

===Academia===
Since Rand's death in 1982, interest in her work has gradually increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=114–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=John R. |editor-last=Shook |first1=Gregory |last1=Salmieri |first2=Allan |last2=Gotthelf |author2-link=Allan Gotthelf |chapter=Rand, Ayn (1905–82) |title=The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers |publisher=Thoemmes Continuum |location=London |year=2005 |isbn=1-84371-037-4 |oclc=53388453 |lastauthoramp=y |volume=4 |page=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McLemee |first=Scott |url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9909/rand.html |title=The Heirs Of Ayn Rand: Has Objectivism Gone Subjective? |journal=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]] |month=September |year=1999 |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=45–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Jennifer Burns has identified &quot;three overlapping waves&quot; of scholarly interest in Rand, the most recent of which is &quot;an explosion of scholarship&quot; in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, few universities currently include Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academic philosophers have criticized Rand for what they consider her lack of rigor and limited understanding of philosophical subject matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kukathas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=reception/&gt; ''[[The Philosophical Lexicon]]'', a satirical web site maintained by philosophers [[Daniel Dennett]] and Asbjørn Steglich-Petersen, defines a 'rand' as: &quot;An angry tirade occasioned by mistaking philosophical disagreement for a personal attack and/or evidence of unspeakable moral corruption.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophicallexicon.com/#R |title=The Philosophical Lexicon: R |first1=Daniel |last1=Dennett |authorlink1=Daniel Dennett |first2=Asbjørn |last2=Steglich-Petersen |year=2008 |accessdate=August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]] has called into question the motives of some of Rand's critics because of what he calls the unusual hostility of their criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=9–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sciabarra writes, &quot;The left was infuriated by her anti-communist, pro-capitalist politics, whereas the right was disgusted with her atheism and civil libertarianism.&quot;&lt;ref name=reception&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics with an interest in Rand, such as Gladstein, Sciabarra, [[Allan Gotthelf]], [[Edwin A. Locke]] and [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]], have taught her work in academic institutions. Sciabarra co-edits the ''[[Journal of Ayn Rand Studies]]'', a nonpartisan peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of Rand's philosophical and literary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Chris Matthew |last=Sciabarra |authorlink=Chris Matthew Sciabarra |url=http://www.freeradical.co.nz/content/57/TheJournalofAynRandStudies.php |title=The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies: Four Years and Counting |journal=The Free Radical |issue=57 |month=July/August |year=2003 |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 Gotthelf helped found the Ayn Rand Society, and has been active in sponsoring seminars about Rand and her ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrandsociety.org/ |title=Ayn Rand Society |accessdate=October 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand's ideas, including ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist'', a volume on Rand's ethical theory published by [[Cambridge University Press]].

===Institutes===
In 1985, [[Leonard Peikoff]] established the [[Ayn Rand Institute]], which &quot;works to introduce young people to Ayn Rand's novels, to support scholarship and research based on her ideas, and to promote the principles of reason, rational self-interest, individual rights and laissez-faire capitalism to the widest possible audience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=8345 |title=Charity Navigator Rating - The Ayn Rand Institute |publisher=[[Charity Navigator]] |accessdate=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, [[David Kelley]] founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; now known as [[The Atlas Society]]. In 2001 historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation has supported research at the [[University of Texas at Austin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anthem Foundation Renews Gift for Ayn Rand Research on 50th Anniversary of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; |date=October 1, 2007 |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2007/10/01/lib_arts-2/ |accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[Duke University]] and other schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anthemfoundation.org/gifts-to-universities/fellowships.html |title=Fellowships &amp;amp; Other Multi-Year Gifts |publisher=Anthem Foundation |accessdate=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alain Connes''' (born 1 April 1947) is a French [[mathematician]], currently Professor at the [[Collège de France]], [[IHÉS]] and [[Vanderbilt University]].

==Work==
Alain Connes is one of the leading specialists on [[operator algebra]]s. In his early work on [[von Neumann algebras]] in the 1970s, he succeeded in obtaining the almost complete classification of injective [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]]s. Following this he made contributions in [[K-theory|operator K-theory]] and [[index theory]], which culminated in the 
[[Baum-Connes conjecture]]. He also introduced [[cyclic homology|cyclic cohomology]] in the early 1980s as a first step in the study of [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative differential geometry]].

Connes has applied his work in areas of [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], including [[number theory]], [[differential geometry]] and [[particle physics]].

==Awards and honours==

Connes was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1982, the [[Crafoord Prize]] in 2001 and the gold medal of the [[CNRS]] in 2004.  He is a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and several foreign academies and societies, including the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters|Danish Academy of Sciences]], [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters|Norwegian Academy of Sciences]], [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and [[United States National Academy of Sciences|US National Academy of Sciences]].

'''Allan Dwan''' (April 3, 1885 – December 28, 1981) was a pioneering [[Canada|Canadian]]-born American [[film|motion picture]] [[film director|director]], producer and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Born '''Joseph Aloysius Dwan''' in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], Dwan moved with his family to the United States when he was 11&amp;nbsp;years old. At the University of Notre Dame, he trained as an engineer and began working for a lighting company in [[Chicago]]. However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in [[California]] where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part time in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. While still in [[New York]], in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].

==Career==
After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed 1922 ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''.

Following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], in 1937 he directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi]]'' and ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' the following year.

Over his long and successful career spanning over 50&amp;nbsp;years, he directed over 400&amp;nbsp;motion pictures, many of them highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office smash, ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. He directed his last movie in 1961.

He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], [[Mission Hills, California|Mission Hills]], [[California]].

Allan Dwan has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital of Algeria is [[Algiers]].

Algeria is a member of the [[Arab League]], [[United Nations]], [[African Union]], and [[OPEC]]. It is also a founding member of the [[Arab Maghreb Union]].

== Etymology ==

The name of the country is derived from the city of [[Algiers]]. A possible etymology links the city name to الجزائر ''Al-jazā’ir'', a truncated form of the city's older name of جزائر بني مازغان jazā’ir banī mazghanā, the Arabic for &quot;the islands of Mazghanna&quot;, as used by early medieval geographers such as [[al-Idrisi]]

In classical times northern Algeria was known as [[Numidia]], which included parts of modern day western [[Tunisia]] and eastern [[Morocco]].

== History ==

{{Main|History of Algeria}}

=== Ancient history ===

[[File:Roman Arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria 04966r.jpg|thumb|left|Roman arch of Trajan at Thamugadi ([[Timgad]]), Algeria]]

In Antiquity Algeria was known as the [[Numidia]] kingdom and its people were called [[Numidians]]. The kingdom of Numidia had early relations with [[Carthaginians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[Ancient Greeks]],  the region was considered a fertile area, and Numidians were known for their fine cavalry.
[[File:GM Massinissa.png|thumb|right|[[Massinissa]] the most famous king of [[Numidia]]]]

The indigenous peoples of [[northern Africa]] eventually coalesced into a distinct native population, the [[Berber people|Berbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Berbers|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=1997|chapter=Berbers in Antiquity|isbn=978-0-631-20767-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8Zcz91t29ukC&amp;dq=The+Berbers+%28The+Peoples+of+Africaand many29|accessdate=2 February 2010|author=Michael Brett, Elizabeth Fentress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1000 BCE, the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] began establishing settlements along the coast. The Berbers seized the opportunity offered by the [[Punic Wars]] to become independent of Carthage, and Berber kingdoms began to emerge, most notably Numidia.

In 200 BCE, they were once again taken over, this time by the [[Roman Republic]]. When the [[Western Roman Empire]] collapsed in 476&amp;nbsp;AD, Berbers became independent again in many regions, while the [[Vandals]] took control over other areas, where they remained until expelled by the [[Byzantine]] general [[Belisarius]] under the direction of [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Emperor]] [[Justinian I]]. The Byzantine Empire then retained a precarious grip on the east of the country until the coming of the [[Arab people|Arabs]] in the 8th century.

=== Middle Ages ===

Berber people controlled much of the [[Maghreb]] region throughout the Middle Ages. The Berbers were made up of several tribes. The two main branches were Botr and Barnès, who were themselves divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, [[Sanhadja]], Houaras, [[Zenata]], [[Masmouda]], [[Kutama]], Awarba, and [[Berghwata]]). All these tribes had independence and made territorial decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR2&amp;dq=in+khaldoun#PPR15,M1 |title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane |language=French |pages=XV |publisher=|date=|accessdate=2009-02-28|author1=Khaldūn, Ibn|year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Berber dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb, Sudan, Andalusia, Italy, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Egypt, and other nearby lands. [[Ibn Khaldun]] provides a table summarizing the Berber dynasties: [[Zirid]], [[Banu Ifran]], [[Maghrawa]], [[Almoravid]], [[Hammadid]], [[Almohad]], [[Merinid]], [[Abdalwadid]], [[Wattasid]] , [[Meknassa]] and [[Hafsid]] dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H3RBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR115&amp;dq=ibn+khaldoun#PPR10,M1 |title=Histoire des Berbères et des dynasties musulmanes de l'Afrique Septentrionale Par Ibn Khaldūn, William MacGuckin Slane |language=French |pages=X |publisher=|date=|accessdate=2009-02-28|author1=Khaldūn, Ibn|year=1852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrival of Islam ===

[[File:Grande mosquée d'Alger.jpg|thumb|upright|Great Mosque of Algiers]]

When Muslim Arabs arrived in Algeria in the mid-7th century, a large number of locals converted to the new faith. After the fall of the [[Umayyad]] Arab Dynasty in 751, numerous local Berber dynasties emerged. Amongst those dynasties were the [[Aghlabids]], [[Almohads]], [[Abdalwadid]], [[Zirids]], [[Rustamids]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravids]], and the [[Fatimids]].

Having converted the Berber [[Kutama]] of [[Kabylie]] to its cause, the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Fatimid]]s overthrew the [[Rustamid]]s, and conquered Egypt, leaving Algeria and Tunisia to their [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid vassals]]. When the latter rebelled, the Shia Fatimids sent in the [[Banu Hilal]], a populous Arab tribe, to weaken them.

=== Spanish enclaves ===

{{See also|Oran#Spanish period|Spanish Empire|History of Algeria}}

The Spanish expansionist policy in North Africa began with the Catholic monarchs [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and their regent [[Cardinal Cisneros|Cisneros]], once the ''[[Reconquista]]'' of the Iberian Peninsula was completed. Several towns and outposts on the Algerian coast were conquered and occupied by the [[Spanish Empire]]: [[Mers El Kébir]] (1505), [[Oran]] (1509), [[Algiers]] (1510) and [[Bejaia|Bugia]] (1510). On 15 January 1510 the King of Algiers, Samis El Felipe, was forced into submission to the king of Spain. King El Felipe called for help from the [[corsairs]] [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] and [[Oruç Reis]] who previously helped [[Andalusia]]n Muslims and Jews escape from Spanish oppression in 1492. In 1516, Oruç Reis conquered Algiers with the support of 1,300 Turkish soldiers on board 16 [[Galliots]] and became ruler, with Algiers joining the [[Ottoman Empire]].

[[File:Oran Santa Cruz.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The Spanish fort of [[Santa Cruz, Oran|Santa Cruz]], [[Oran]].]]

The Spaniards left Algiers in 1529, Bujia in 1554, Mers El Kébir and Oran in 1708. The Spanish returned in 1732 when the armada of the [[José Carrillo de Albornoz, 1st Duke of Montemar|Duke of Montemar]] was victorious in the [[Battle of Aïn-el-Turk]]; Spain recaptured Oran and Mers El Kébir. Both cities were held until 1792, when they were sold by King [[Charles IV of Spain]] to the [[History of Ottoman Algeria|Bey of Algiers]].

=== Ottoman rule ===

[[File:MoorishAmbassador to Elizabeth I.jpg|thumb|upright|The Moorish ambassador of the Barbary States to the Court of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]].]]

Algeria was made part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] by [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] and his brother Aruj in 1517. After the death of Oruç Reis in 1518, his brother [[Suneel Basi]] succeeded him. The Sultan [[Selim I]] sent him 6000 soldiers and 2000 [[janissary|janissaries]] with which he conquered most of the Algerian territory taken by the Spanish, from [[Annaba]] to [[Mostaganem]]. Further Spanish attacks led by [[Hugo of Moncada]] in 1519 were also pushed back. In 1541 [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], attacked Algiers with a convoy of 65 warships, 451 ships and 23000 men including 2000 riders, but it was a total failure, and the Algerian leader Hassan Agha became a national hero. Algiers then became a great military power.

The Ottomans established Algeria's modern boundaries in the north and made its coast a base for the [[Barbary pirate|Ottoman corsairs]]; their [[privateer]]ing peaked in Algiers in the 17th century. Piracy on [[United States|American]] vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the [[First Barbary War|First]] (1801–1805) and [[Second Barbary War]]s (1815) with the United States. The pirates forced the people on the ships they captured into [[slavery]]; when the pirates attacked coastal villages in southern and Western Europe the inhabitants were forced into the [[Arab slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/history/American_and_Military/Barbary_Pirates/Britannica_1911*.html |title=Barbary Pirates—Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1911 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barbary pirates, also sometimes called [[History of the Turkish Navy#Famous admirals|Ottoman corsairs]] or the Marine Jihad (الجهاد البحري), were Muslim pirates and privateers that operated from North Africa, from the time of the [[Crusades]] until the early 19th century. Based in North African ports such as [[Tunis]] in Tunisia, [[Tripoli]] in Libya, [[Algiers]] in Algeria, they preyed on [[Christian]] and other non-[[Islam]]ic shipping in the western [[Mediterranean Sea]].

[[File:Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]]]]

Their stronghold was along the stretch of northern Africa known as the [[Barbary Coast]] (a medieval term for the [[Maghreb]] after its [[Berber people|Berber]] inhabitants), but their predation was said to extend throughout the Mediterranean, south along [[West Africa]]'s Atlantic seaboard, and into the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] as far north as [[Iceland]] and the United States. They often made raids, called ''[[Razzia]]s'', on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at [[Islam and slavery#Oriental slave trade|slave markets]] in places such as [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], Algeria and Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_02.shtml |title=British Slaves on the Barbary Coast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/17_2_urbanities-thomas_jefferson.html |title=Jefferson Versus the Muslim Pirates by Christopher Hitchens, City Journal Spring 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million [[Europe]]ans as slaves. These slaves were captured mainly from seaside villages in [[Italy]], Spain and [[Portugal]], and from farther places like [[France]], [[England]], [[Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Scandinavia]] and even [[Iceland]], India, [[Southeast Asia]] and North America.

The impact of these [[List of Ottoman sieges and landings|attacks]] was devastating – France, England, and Spain each lost thousands of ships, and long stretches of coast in Spain and Italy were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants. Pirate raids discouraged settlement along the coast until the 19th century.

The most famous corsairs were the Ottoman ''Barbarossa'' (&quot;Redbeard&quot;) brothers — [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Hayreddin (Hızır)]] and his older brother [[Oruç Reis]] — who took control of Algiers in the early 16th century and turned it into the centre of Mediterranean piracy and privateering for three centuries, as well as establishing the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s presence in North Africa which lasted four centuries.

Other famous Ottoman privateer-admirals included [[Turgut Reis]] (known as [[Dragut]] in the West), [[Kurtoğlu Muslihiddin Reis|Kurtoğlu]] (known as [[Kurtoğlu Muslihiddin Reis|Curtogoli]] in the West), [[Kemal Reis]], [[Salih Reis]], [[Nemdil Reis]] and [[Murat Reis the Older|Koca Murat Reis]]. Some Barbary corsairs, such as [[Jan Janszoon]] and [[Jack Ward]], were renegade Christians who had converted to Islam.

[[File:Evasion de cinbq esclaves anglais a bord d un radeau.jpg|thumb|Five British escaping slavery from [[Algiers]], a Dutch painting.]]

In 1544, Hayreddin captured the island of [[Ischia]], taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of [[Lipari]], almost the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/09/26/trsic_ed3_.php |title=The mysteries and majesties of the Aeolian Islands}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1551, [[Turgut Reis]] enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island [[Gozo]], between 5,000 and 6,000, sending them to Libya. In 1554, pirates sacked [[Vieste]] in southern Italy and took an estimated 7,000 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centrovacanzeoriente.it/cvoriente/en/dintorni.jsp |title=Vieste}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1555, Turgut Reis sacked [[Bastia]], [[Corsica]], taking 6000 prisoners.

In 1558, Barbary corsairs captured the town of [[Ciutadella]] (Minorca), destroyed it, slaughtered the inhabitants and took 3,000 survivors to [[Istanbul]] as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holidays2menorca.com/history.php |title=History of Menorca}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1563, Turgut Reis landed on the shores of the province of [[Granada]], Spain, and captured coastal settlements in the area, such as [[Almuñécar]], along with 4,000 prisoners. Barbary pirates often attacked the [[Balearic Islands]], and in response many coastal watchtowers and fortified [[church (building)|churches]] were erected. The threat was so severe that the island of [[Formentera]] became uninhabited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm |title=''When Europeans were slaves: Research suggests white slavery was much more common than previously believed''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elbacomunico.com/inglese/pirates.htm |title=Watch-towers and fortified towns}}{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1609 to 1616, England lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates.&lt;ref&gt;Rees Davies, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/white_slaves_01.shtml British Slaves on the Barbary Coast], [[BBC]], 1 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, Barbary pirates would capture ships and enslave the crew.

On the pretext of a slight to their consul, the French invaded and captured Algiers in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alistair Horne, |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962 (New York Review Books Classics) |publisher=NYRB Classics |location=1755 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 |year=2006 |pages=29–30 |isbn=978-1-59017-218-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest of Algeria by the French was long and resulted in considerable bloodshed. A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous Algerian population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103772b Gallica.bnf.fr], La démographie figurée de l'Algérie, op.cit., p.260 et 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people emigrated to Algeria,&lt;ref&gt;'France – Republic, Monarchy, and Empire' By Keith Randell&lt;/ref&gt; but the conquest was slow because of intense resistance from such people as [[Emir Abdelkader]], [[Cheikh Mokrani]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, [[Cheikh Bouamama]], the tribe of [[Ouled Sid Cheikh]], whose relationships with the French vacillated from cooperation to resistance,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} [[Ahmed Bey]] and [[Lalla Fatma N'Soumer|Fatma N'Soumer]]. Indeed, the conquest was not technically complete until the early 20th century when the last [[Taureg people|Tuareg]] were conquered.

Meanwhile, however, the French made Algeria an integral part of France. Tens of thousands of settlers from France, Spain, Italy, and [[Malta]] moved in to farm the Algerian coastal plain and occupied significant parts of Algeria's cities.

These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alistair Horne, |title=A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954–1962 (New York Review Books Classics) |publisher=NYRB Classics |location=1755 Broadway, New York, NY 10019 |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-59017-218-6 |oclc=|doi=|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria's social fabric suffered during the occupation: literacy plummeted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-365.html |title=Country Data |publisher=Country-data.com |date=|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; while land development uprooted much of the population.

Starting from the end of the 19th century, people of European descent in Algeria (or natives like [[Spanish people]] in [[Oran]]), as well as the native [[Algerian Jews]] (classified as [[Sephardi Jews]]), became full French citizens. Formally Algeria as a French territory was member of European Communities from the founding of the [[European Communities|European Community of Coal and Steel (ECSC)]] in 1952. Formal membership ended with independence in 1962.

After Algeria's 1962 independence, the Europeans were called ''[[pied-noir|Pieds-Noirs]]'' (&quot;black feet&quot;). Some apocryphal sources suggest the title comes from the black boots settlers wore, but the term seems not to have been widely used until the time of the Algerian War of Independence and it's more likely it started as an insult towards settlers returning from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Memory and Postcolonial Europe, Andrea L. Smith, Indiana University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the vast majority of [[Muslim]] Algerians (even veterans of the French army) received neither French citizenship nor the right to vote.

=== Post-independence ===
[[File:Monument of the Martyrs 01 Algiers.jpg|thumb|The [[Monument des Martyrs]] (Maqam E'chahid) in Algiers]] [[File:Algeri04.jpg|thumb|Cosmopolitan Algiers]]
In 1954, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) launched the [[Algerian War of Independence]] which was a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign. By the end of the war, newly elected [[President of France|President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] held a [[referendum|plebiscite]], offering Algerians [[Algerian_War#End_of_the_war|three options]]. In a famous speech (4 June 1958 in [[Algiers]]) de Gaulle proclaimed in front of a vast crowd of Pieds-Noirs &quot;Je vous ai compris&quot; (I have understood you). Most Pieds-noirs then believed that de Gaulle meant that Algeria would remain French. The poll resulted in a landslide vote for complete independence from [[France]]. Over one million people, 10% of the population, then fled the country for France in just a few months in mid-1962. These included most of the 1,025,000 ''Pieds-Noirs'', as well as 81,000 ''[[Harki]]s'' (pro-French Algerians serving in the French Army). In the days preceding the bloody conflict, a group of [[Algerian Rebels]] opened fire on a marketplace in [[Oran]] killing numerous innocent civilians, mostly women. It is estimated that somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000 ''Harkis'' and their dependents were killed by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] or by lynch mobs in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7130307.stm | accessdate = | work=BBC News | title=French 'reparation' for Algerians | date=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria's first president was the FLN leader [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. He was overthrown by his former ally and defense minister, [[Houari Boumédienne]] in 1965. Under Ben Bella the government had already become increasingly [[socialism|socialist]] and [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]], and this trend continued throughout Boumédienne's government. However, Boumédienne relied much more heavily on the army, and reduced the sole legal party to a merely symbolic role. [[Agriculture]] was [[collective farming|collectivised]], and a massive [[industrialization]] drive launched. [[Extraction of petroleum|Oil extraction]] facilities were nationalized. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. However, the Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil which led to hardship when the price collapsed during the [[1980s oil glut]].

In foreign policy Algeria has strained relations with its western neighbor [[Morocco]]. Reasons for this include Morocco's disputed claim to [[Greater Morocco|portions of western Algeria]] (which led to the [[Sand War]] in 1963), Algeria's support for the [[Polisario Front]] for its right to [[self-determination]], and Algeria's hosting of [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] refugees within its borders in the city of [[Tindouf]].

Within Algeria, dissent was rarely tolerated, and the state's control over the [[Mass media|media]] and the outlawing of political parties other than the FLN was cemented in the repressive [[Constitution of Algeria|constitution of 1976]].

Boumédienne died in 1978, but the rule of his successor, [[Chadli Bendjedid]], was little more open. The state took on a strongly [[bureaucratic]] character and [[Political corruption|corruption]] was widespread.

The modernization drive brought considerable [[demography|demographic]] changes to Algeria. Village traditions underwent significant change as [[urbanization]] increased. New industries emerged and agricultural employment was substantially reduced. [[Education]] was extended nationwide, raising the [[literacy]] rate from less than 10% to over 60%. There was a dramatic increase in the [[fertility rate]] to 7–8 children per mother.

Therefore by 1980, there was a very youthful population and a housing crisis. The new generation struggled to relate to the cultural obsession with the war years and two conflicting protest movements developed: communists, including [[Berber]] identity movements; and [[Islamic]] 'intégristes'. Both groups protested against [[one-party rule]] but also clashed with each other in universities and on the streets during the 1980s. Mass protests from both camps in autumn 1988 forced Bendjedid to concede the end of one-party rule.

==== Algerian political events (1991–2002) ====
{{Main|Algerian Civil War}}

[[File:Algiers coast.jpg|thumb|left|Algiers]]
The first round of elections were held in 1991. In December 1991, the [[Islamic Salvation Front]] won the [[Algerian National Assembly elections, 1991|first round]] of the country's first multi-party elections. The military then intervened, declared a state of emergency that limited freedom of speech and assembly, and canceled the second round of elections. It forced then-president Bendjedid to resign and banned all political parties based on religion (including the Islamic Salvation Front). A political conflict ensued, leading Algeria into the violent [[Algerian Civil War]].

More than 160,000 people were killed between 17 January 1992 and June 2002. Most of the deaths were between militants and government troops, but a great number of civilians were also killed. The question of who was responsible for these deaths was controversial at the time amongst academic observers; many were claimed by the [[Armed Islamic Group]]. Though many of these massacres were undoubtedly carried out by Islamic extremists, some{{who|date=February 2011}} claimed that the Algerian regime used the army, and foreign mercenaries, to conduct attacks on men, women, and children, and then proceeded to blame the attacks upon various Islamic groups within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khilafah.com/kcom/analysis/africa/an-overview-of-recent-events-in-algeria.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070807014105/http://www.khilafah.com/kcom/analysis/africa/an-overview-of-recent-events-in-algeria.html |archivedate=2007-08-07 |title=Khilafah – An overview of recent events in Algeria |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections resumed in 1995, and after 1998, the war waned. On 27 April 1999, after a series of short-term leaders representing the [[military]], [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], the current president, was chosen by the army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arab.de/arabinfo/algehis.htm Arabic German Consulting] www.Arab.de. Retrieved 4 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post war ====
By 2002, the main guerrilla groups had either been destroyed or surrendered, taking advantage of an [[amnesty]] program, though fighting and terrorism continues in some areas (See [[Islamic insurgency in Algeria (2002–present)]]).

The issue of [[Amazigh languages]] and identity increased in significance, particularly after the extensive [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] protests of 2001 and the near-total boycott of local elections in [[Kabylie]]. The government responded with concessions including naming of Tamazight (Berber) as a national language and teaching it in schools.

Much of Algeria is now recovering and developing into an [[emerging economy]]. The high prices of oil and [[natural gas]] are being used by the new government to improve the country's [[infrastructure]] and especially improve [[industry]] and agricultural land.

==== Popular Protests - 2010-present ====
{{Main|2010–2011 Algerian protests}}
Following a wave of Protests in the wake of popular uprisings in [[Tunisian Revolution|Tunisia]], [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]], and [[2011 Libyan uprising|Libya]], Algeria has officially lifted its 19-year-old state of emergency on February 24, 2011.

[[File:Algeria Topography.png|thumb|Topographic map of Algeria]]
Algeria lies mostly between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19°]] and [[37th parallel north|37°N]] (a small area is north of 37°), and longitudes [[9th meridian west|9°W]] and [[12th meridian east|12°E]]. Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural [[harbour]]s. The area from the coast to the [[Tell Atlas]] is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a [[steppe]] landscape, which ends with the [[Saharan Atlas]]; further south, there is the [[Sahara]] desert.

The [[Ahaggar Mountains]] ({{lang-ar|جبال هقار}}), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about {{convert|1500|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the capital, Algiers and just west of [[Tamanghasset]].

Algiers, [[Oran]], [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], [[Tizi Ouzou]] and [[Annaba]] are Algeria's main cities.

Currently the second largest country in Africa after [[Sudan]], Algeria will become the continent's largest country should [[Southern Sudan]] secede from [[Sudan]] as expected in July 2011.

== Climate ==
{{Main|Climate of Algeria}}
In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.

The highest official temperature was {{convert|50.6|°C|°F}} at In Salah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mherrera.org/temp.htm MHerrera.org] and Burt, Christopher C. 'Extreme Weather: A Guide and Record Book (W.W. Norton Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainfall is fairly abundant along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from {{convert|400|to|670|mm|1|abbr=on}} annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as {{convert|1000|mm|1|abbr=on}} in some years.

Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. [[Prevailing winds]] that are easterly and north-easterly in summer change to westerly and northerly in winter and carry with them a general increase in precipitation from September through December, a decrease in the late winter and spring months, and a near absence of rainfall during the summer months. Algeria also has [[erg (landform)|ergs]], or sand dunes between mountains. Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can get up to {{convert|110|°F|°C|1|abbr=on}}.

[[File:President-abdelaziz-bouteflika.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], President of Algeria]]
The head of state is the president of Algeria, who is elected for a five-year term. The president was formerly limited to two five-year terms but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on November 11, 2008 removed this limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7724635.stm |title=BBC NEWS | Africa | Algeria deputies scrap term limit |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria has universal [[suffrage]] at 18 years of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; The President is the head of the Council of Ministers and of the High Security Council. He appoints the [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Prime Minister]] who is also the head of government. The Prime Minister appoints the Council of Ministers.

The Algerian [[parliament]] is [[bicameral]], consisting of a lower chamber, the ''National People's Assembly (APN)'', with 380 members; and an upper chamber, the ''Council Of Nation'', with 144 members. The APN is elected every five years.

Under the 1976 [[constitution]] (as modified 1979, and amended in 1988, 1989, and 1996) Algeria is a multi-party state. The Ministry of the Interior must approve all parties. To date, Algeria has had more than 40 legal political parties. According to the constitution, no political association may be formed if it is &quot;based on differences in religion, language, race, gender or region.&quot;

The military of Algeria consists of the [[People's National Army]] (ANP), the [[Algerian National Navy]] (MRA), and the [[Algerian Air Force]] (QJJ), plus the Territorial Air Defense Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; It is the direct successor of the [[Armée de Libération Nationale]] (ALN), the armed wing of the nationalist National Liberation Front, which fought French colonial [[military occupation|occupation]] during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62). The commander-in-chief of the military is the president, who is also Minister of National Defense.

Total military personnel include 147,000 active, 150,000 reserve, and 187,000 paramilitary staff (2008 estimate).&lt;ref name=IISS_TMB&gt;{{cite book |title=The Military Balance 2008 |author=Hackett, James (ed.)|others=International Institute for Strategic Studies |date=5 February 2008|publisher=Europa |isbn=978-1-85743-461-3| url=http://www.zawya.com/printstory.cfm?storyid=v51n20-1TS05&amp;l=134200080519|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service in the military is compulsory for men aged 19–30, for a total of 18 months (six training and 12 in civil projects).&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; The total military expenditure in 2006 was estimated variously at 2.7% of GDP (3,096 million),&lt;ref name=IISS_TMB/&gt; or 3.3% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

Algeria has its force oriented toward its western (Morocco) and eastern (Libyan) neighbors borders[no resource provided to confirm the allegation]. Its primary military supplier has been the former [[Soviet Union]], which has sold various types of sophisticated equipment under military trade agreements, and the [[People's Republic of China]]. Algeria has attempted, in recent years, to diversify its sources of military material. Military forces are supplemented by a 70,000-member [[gendarmerie]] or rural police force under the control of the president and 30,000-member ''Sûreté nationale'' or metropolitan [[police]] force under the Ministry of the Interior.

The Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia in 2007, to purchase 49 [[MiG-29]]SMT and 6 MiG-29UBT at an estimated $1.9 billion. They also agreed to return old [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] purchased from the [[Former USSR]]. Russia is also building two [[Kilo class submarine|636-type]] diesel [[submarines]] for Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=070614062644.0d1z4l69&amp;show_article=1| title=Venezuela's Chavez to finalise Russian submarines deal| publisher=Breitbart| date=2007-06-14| accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2009, it was reported that Algeria had cancelled a weapons deal with France over the possibility of inclusion of Israeli parts in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoprod.co.il/article/2/301 |title=Algeria cancels weapons deal over Israeli parts |publisher=Infoprod.co.il |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arab Maghreb Union ===
Tensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the [[Western Sahara]] have put great obstacles in the way of tightening the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], which was nominally established in 1989 but carried little practical weight with its coastal neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/990219/1999021906.html ArabicNews.com], Bin Ali calls for reactivating Arab Maghreb Union, Tunisia-Maghreb, Politics, 19 February 1999.

== Provinces and districts ==
{{Main|Provinces of Algeria|Districts of Algeria|Municipalities of Algeria}}
[[File:Algeria wilayat.png|thumb|left|Map of the provinces of Algeria numbered according to the official order]]
Algeria is divided into 48 [[provinces of Algeria|provinces]] (''[[wilaya]]s''), 553 [[districts of Algeria|districts]] (''[[daïra]]s'') and 1,541 [[Municipalities of Algeria|municipalities]] (''[[baladiyah]]s''). Each province, district, and municipality is named after its [[Capital (political)|seat]], which is usually the largest city.
According to the Algerian constitution, a province is ''a territorial collectivity enjoying some economic freedom''.

The [[People's Provincial Assembly]] is the political entity governing a province, which has a &quot;president&quot;, who is elected by the members of the assembly. They are in turn elected on [[universal suffrage]] every five years. The &quot;[[Wāli#Algerian term|Wali]]&quot; ([[Prefect]] or [[governor]]) directs each province. This person is chosen by the Algerian President to handle the PPA's decisions.

The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence. When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order. With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are:&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Algeria}}
[[File:Ministerefinacealger.jpg|thumb|Ministry of Finance of Algeria]]
The fossil fuels energy sector is the backbone of Algeria's economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]], and over 95% of export earnings. The country ranks 14th in [[petroleum]] reserves, containing {{convert|11.8|Goilbbl}} of proven [[oil reserves]] with estimates suggesting that the actual amount is even more. The U.S. [[Energy Information Administration]] reported that in 2005, Algeria had {{convert|160|Tcuft}} of proven [[natural gas reserves]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ciawfb&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2179rank.html Retrieved 16 March 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; the eighth largest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;eia&quot;&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/algeria.html Algeria Country Analysis Brief], EIA, March 2005. Retrieved 18 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Average annual non-hydrocarbon GDP growth averaged 6 percent in 2003-2007, with total GDP growing at an average of 4.5 percent during the same period due to less buoyant oil production in 2006-07. External debt has been virtually eliminated, and the government has accumulated large savings in the oil stabilization fund (FRR). Inflation, the lowest in the region, has remained stable at 4 percent on average for 2003-07.&lt;ref name=&quot;MFW4A&quot;&gt;[http://www.mfw4a.org/algeria/algeria-financial-sector-profile.html], MFW4A, Algeria Financial Sector Profile&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria's financial and economic indicators improved during the mid-1990s, in part because of policy reforms supported by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[debt]] rescheduling from the [[Paris Club]]. Algeria's finances in 2000 and 2001 benefited from an increase in [[Price of petroleum|oil prices]] and the government's tight fiscal policy, leading to a large increase in the trade surplus, record highs in foreign exchange reserves, and reduction in [[foreign debt]].

The government's continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic [[investment]] outside the energy sector have had little success in reducing high [[unemployment]] and improving living standards, however. In 2001, the government signed an Association Treaty with the [[European Union]] that will eventually lower tariffs and increase trade. In March 2006, Russia agreed to erase $4.74 billion of Algeria's [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era debt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brtsis.com/ |title=Brtsis, brief on Russian defence, trade, security and energy |publisher=Brtsis.com |date=|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a visit by [[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] to the country, the first by a Russian leader in half a century. In return, president [[Bouteflika]] agreed to buy $7.5 billion worth of combat planes, air-defense systems and other arms from Russia, according to the head of Russia's state arms exporter [[Rosoboronexport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia agrees Algeria arms deal, writes off debt |publisher=Reuters |date=11 March 2006 |url=http://za.today.reuters.com/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=businessNews&amp;storyID=2006-03-11T082958Z_01_BAN130523_RTRIDST_0_OZABS-ECONOMY-RUSSIA-ALGERIA-20060311.XML}} {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} {{cite news |title=La Russie efface la dette algérienne |publisher=Radio France International |date=10 March 2006 |url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/075/article_42379.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria also decided in 2006 to pay off its full $8bn (£4.3bn) debt to the [[Paris Club]] group of rich creditor nations before schedule. This will reduce the Algerian foreign debt to less than $5bn in the end of 2006. The [[Paris Club]] said the move reflected Algeria's economic recovery in recent years.

== Agriculture ==
{{Main|Agriculture in Algeria}}
Algeria has always been noted for the fertility of its soil. 25% of Algerians are employed in the agricultural sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ |title=CIA factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date=|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A considerable amount of [[cotton]] was grown at the time of the United States' [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but the industry declined afterwards. In the early years of the 20th century efforts to extend the cultivation of the plant were renewed. A small amount of [[cotton]] is also grown in the southern oases. Large quantities of dwarf palm are cultivated for the leaves, the fibers of which resemble [[Mane (horse)|horsehair]]. The [[olive]] (both for its fruit and oil) and [[tobacco]] are cultivated with great success.

More than {{convert|30000|km2|acres|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} are devoted to the cultivation of [[cereal grain]]s. The [[Tell Atlas]] is the grain-growing land. During the time of French rule its productivity was increased substantially by the sinking of [[artesian aquifer|artesian wells]] in districts which only required water to make them fertile. Of the crops raised, [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[oat]]s are the principal cereals. A great variety of [[vegetable]]s and [[fruit]]s, especially [[citrus]] products, are exported. Algeria also exports [[ficus|figs]], [[date (fruit)|dates]], [[esparto|esparto grass]], and [[cork (material)|cork]]. It is the largest [[oat]] market in Africa.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Algeria}}
[[File:Basilique Notre-Dame d Afrique Alger.jpg|thumb|right|[[Notre Dame d'Afrique]] (Our Lady of Africa) is a [[Roman Catholic]] church that is the [[basilica]] of [[Algiers]]]]
The population of Algeria is 34,895,000 (January 2010 est.), with 99% classified ethnically as Arab or Berber.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt;
About 90% of Algerians live in the northern, coastal area; the minority who inhabit the [[Sahara]] are mainly concentrated in [[oasis|oases]], although some 1.5 million remain [[nomad]]ic or partly nomadic. Almost 30% of Algerians are under the age of 15. Algeria has the fourth lowest [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|fertility rate]] in the [[Greater Middle East]], after those of [[Cyprus]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Turkey]].

Most Algerians have ancestry coming from Arabs, Berbers, and to a lesser extend Southern Europeans and Sub-Saharan Africans. Furthermore, the country has a diverse population ranging from light skinned, blue eyed Kabyles in the atlas mountains to dark skinned Black African looking populations in the Sahara (e.g. the Tuaregs and Gnawa). Descendants of [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] refugees are also present in the population of Algiers and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;John Douglas Ruedy (2005). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=WIRWgrbE_fEC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Modern Algeria: the origins and development of a nation]''&quot;. Indiana University Press. p.22. ISBN 0253217822&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistically, ~83% of Algerians speak [[Algerian Arabic]], while ~15% speak Berber dialects who are to be found in the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] and Chaoui regions mainly. [[French language|French]] is widely understood, and [[Standard Arabic]] (FosHaa) is taught to and understood by most [[Algerian]] Arabic-speaking youth.

Europeans account for less than 1% of the population, inhabiting almost exclusively the largest metropolitan areas. However, during the colonial period there was a large (15.2% in 1962) European population, consisting primarily of [[French people]], in addition to [[Spaniards]] in the west of the country, [[Italians]] and [[Maltese people|Maltese]] in the east, and other Europeans such as [[Greeks]] in smaller numbers. Known as ''[[Pied-noir|pieds-noirs]]'', European colonists were concentrated on the coast and formed a majority of the population of [[Oran]] (60%) and important proportions in other large cities like [[Algiers]] and [[Annaba]]. Almost all of this population left during or immediately after the country's independence from France.&lt;ref&gt;Raimondo Cagiano De Azevedo (1994). ''&quot;[http://books.google.com/books?id=N8VHizsqaH0C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Migration and development co-operation.]&quot;''. Council of Europe. p.25. ISBN 9287126119&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortages of housing and medicine continue to be pressing problems in Algeria. Failing infrastructure and the continued influx of people from rural to urban areas has overtaxed both systems. According to the [[UNDP]], Algeria has one of the world's highest per housing unit occupancy rates for housing, and government officials have publicly stated that the country has an immediate shortfall of 1.5 million housing units.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Women make up 70 percent of Algeria's lawyers and 60 percent of its judges, and also dominate the field of medicine. Increasingly, women are contributing more to household income than men. Sixty percent of university students are women, according to university researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Slackman |first=Michael |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/world/africa/26algeria.html |title=A Quiet Revolution in Algeria: Gains by Women – New York Times |doi=Algeria |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=May 26, 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that 95,700 [[refugees]] and [[Right of asylum|asylum]]-seekers have sought refuge in Algeria. This includes roughly 90,000 from Morocco and 4,100 from [[Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]]. &quot;World Refugee Survey 2008.&quot; Available Online at [http://www.refugees.org/countryreports.aspx?id=2116 Refugees.org], pp.34&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 46,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.map.ma/eng/sections/general/only_46000_people_b/view |title=Home: Only 46,000 people benefit from humanitarian aid in Tindouf camps, says former polisario leader |publisher=Map.ma |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sahrawis]] from [[Western Sahara]] live in refugee camps in the Algerian part of the [[Sahara]] Desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/world/africa/04sahara.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print | accessdate = | work=The New York Times | title=Western Sahara's Conflict Traps Refugees in Limbo | first=Cara | last=Buckley | date=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74134 Western Sahara: Lack of donor funds threatens humanitarian projects]&quot;.

=== Ethnic groups ===
{{Main|Ethnic groups in Algeria}}
Algerian Arabs compose Algeria's majority ethnic group, while a significant Berber minority of 25% exists mainly in the north east Kabyle region and in Aures mountains in east of Algeria and others ethnic groups.

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Algeria}}
The [[official language]] of Algeria is (literary) [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as specified in its constitution since 1963.  In addition to this, [[Berber languages|Berber]] has been recognized as a &quot;[[national language]]&quot; by constitutional amendment since May 8, 2002.  Between them, these two [[language]]s are the [[native language]]s of over 99% of Algerians, with Arabic spoken by about 83% and Berber by 15%.&lt;ref name=&quot;leclerc&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[French language|French]], though it has no official status, is still widely used in [[government]], culture, media (newspapers) and [[education]] (taught from [[primary school]]), due to [[French rule in Algeria|Algeria's colonial history]] and can be regarded as being de facto the co-official language of Algeria. The [[Kabyle language]], the most spoken Berber language in the country, is taught and partially co-official (with a few restrictions) in parts of [[Kabylia]].

==== Arabic ====

Algerian colloquial Arabic is spoken as a native language by more than 83%( the figure includes bilingual berbers )  of the population; of these, over 78% speak [[Algerian Arabic]] and around 5% [[Hassaniya]].&lt;ref name=tlfq&gt;{{Fr icon}} – [http://www.tlfq.ulaval.ca/AXL/AFRIQUE/algerie-1demo.htm TLFQ.ulaval.ca], [[Jacques Leclerc (linguiste)|Jacques Leclerc]], L’aménagement linguistique dans le monde. CIRAL (Centre international de recherche en aménagement linguistique)&lt;/ref&gt; Algerian Arabic is spoken as a second language by many Berbers. However, in the media and on official occasions the spoken language is [[Standard Arabic]].

==== Berber ====
[[File:Hoggar caravane2.jpg|thumb|170px|The [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] once controlled the central Sahara desert and its trade.]]
Berber dialects are spoken by around 40% of Algeria's population, mainly in [[Kabylia]], in the [[Aurès]], and in the [[Sahara]] (by [[Tuaregs]]), and also in and around [[Algiers]], the capital city. Long before the [[Phoenicians]]' arrival, Berber was spoken throughout Algeria, as later attested by early [[Tifinagh]] inscriptions. Despite the growth of [[Punic language|Punic]], [[Latin]] and later, [[Arabic]], Berber remained the main language of Algeria until the invasion of the populous [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] tribal confederation in the 11th century.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Algerians speak one of the various dialects of Berber (native name: [[Tamazight]]), which add up to around 38%-45% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;tlfq&quot;/&gt; Arabic remains Algeria's only [[official language]], although Berber has recently been recognized as a [[national language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} – [http://www.apn-dz.org/apn/french/constitution96/loi02_03.htm « Loi n° 02-03 portant révision constitutionnelle »], adopted on 10 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== French ====

[[French language|French]] is the most widely studied [[foreign language]] in the country, and a majority of Algerians can understand it and speak it, though it is usually not spoken in daily life. Since [[independence]], the government has pursued a policy of linguistic Arabization of [[education]] and bureaucracy, which has resulted in limiting the use of [[Berber languages|Berber]] and the Arabization of many Berber-speakers. The strong position of French in Algeria was little affected by the Arabization policy. All scientific and business [[university]] courses are still taught in French. Recently, schools have begun to incorporate French into the curriculum as early as children are taught written classical Arabic. French is also used in media and business. After a political debate in Algeria in the late 1990s about whether to replace French with English in the educational system, the government decided to retain French. English is taught  in the first year of middle schools.

The Punic tongue, a [[Phoenician language]], is believed to have been spoken in several areas of the country. The Punic language died out after the 6th century AD. Algerian cities have commonly been given Punic and [[Latin|ancient Roman]] names.

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Algeria}}

[[Islam]] is the predominant religion with 99% of the population. Almost all Algerian Muslims follow Sunni Islam, with the exception of some 200,000 [[ibadi]]s in the M'zab Valley in the region of [[Ghardaia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/az/rescon/mgcibadi.html |title=Ibadis and Kharijis |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some 250,000 [[Christian]]s in the country, including about 10,000 [[Roman Catholics]] and 150,000 to 200,000 evangelical [[Protestants]] (mainly [[Pentecostal]]), according to the [[Protestant Church of Algeria]]'s leader Mustapha Krim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topchretien.com/topinfo/view/40011/lalgerie-malmene-ses-chretiens.html |title=Top Chrétien |publisher=Topchretien.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vodeo.tv/4-33-5995-le-reveil-des-chretiens-d-algerie.html |title=Vodeo TV |publisher=Vodeo TV |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources claim more than one million Christians in Algeria, most of them live in the [[Kabylie]] area where there are more than 70 underground churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbve.no/nyheter/nyhetsarkiv/over-en-million-jesus-troende-i-algerie///nigeria.html?tx_ttnews[pointer]=8&amp;cHash=fb582259df |title=Over en million Jesus-troende i Algerie |publisher=Troens Bevis - Verdens Evangelisering |date= |accessdate=2010-05-23 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nation has experienced a decline in Christianity as a result of Islamization for over a millennium. Catholic French missionaries converted some Muslim Algerians, and their descendants are called ''[[Évolués]]'', who moved on to France following independence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Algeria had an important Jewish community until the 1960s. Nearly all of this community emigrated following the country's independence, although a very small number of [[Algerian Jews|Jews]] continue to live in Algiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90207.htm |title=U.S. Department of State |publisher=State.gov |date=2007-04-11 |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health ==

{{Main|Health in Algeria}}

In 2002 Algeria had inadequate numbers of physicians (1.13 per 1,000 people), nurses (2.23 per 1,000 people), and dentists (0.31 per 1,000 people). Access to “improved water sources” was limited to 92 percent of the population in urban areas and 80 percent of the population in rural areas. Some 99 percent of Algerians living in urban areas, but only 82 percent of those living in rural areas, had access to “improved sanitation.” According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of “reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015.” Given Algeria’s young population, policy favors preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunization program. However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]], and [[dysentery]]. The poor generally receive health care free of charge.

== Culture ==

{{Main|Culture of Algeria|Music of Algeria|List of Algerian writers}}

Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic,Kabyle and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. [[List of Algerian writers|Famous novelists]] of the 20th century include [[Mohammed Dib]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Kateb Yacine]] and [[Ahlam Mosteghanemi]] while [[Assia Djebar]] is widely translated. Among the important novelists of the 1980s were [[Rachid Mimouni]], later vice-president of Amnesty International, and [[Tahar Djaout]], murdered by an [[Islamist]] group in 1993 for his secularist views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frenchpubagency.com/?fuseaction=people.main&amp;pid=517 Tahar Djaout] French Publishers' Agency and France Edition, Inc. Retrieved 4 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy and the humanities, [[Jacques Derrida]], the father of [[deconstruction]], was born in [[El Biar]] in Algiers; [[Malek Bennabi]] and [[Frantz Fanon]] are noted for their thoughts on [[decolonization]]; [[Augustine of Hippo]] was born in [[Tagaste]] (modern-day [[Souk Ahras]]); and [[Ibn Khaldun]], though born in [[Tunis]], wrote the [[Muqaddima]] while staying in Algeria.
Algerian culture has been strongly influenced by [[Islam in Algeria|Islam]], the main religion. The works of the [[Sanusi]] family in pre-colonial times, and of [[Emir Abdelkader]] and Sheikh [[Ben Badis]] in colonial times, are widely noted. The Latin author [[Apuleius]] was born in [[Madaurus]] (Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria.

In painting, [[Mohammed Khadda]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khadda.com/ Mohammed Khadda] official site. Retrieved 4 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[M'Hamed Issiakhem]] have been notable in recent years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a list of characters in [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]].''

==Major characters==
The following are major characters from the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Characters are listed as &quot;major&quot; if they meet one of the following criteria:
*they are listed as &quot;major&quot; characters in a widely available study guide, such as [[CliffsNotes]], [[SparkNotes]], or [[Gale (Cengage)|Gale's]] ''Novels for Students'';
*they are listed as &quot;primary heroic&quot; or &quot;arch-villain&quot; characters in Gladstein's ''The New Ayn Rand Companion'';
*they are the focus of an essay in a scholarly book about the novel, such as ''Essays on Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged'' or ''Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dagny Taggart===
Dagny Taggart is the [[protagonist]] of the novel. She is Vice-President in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental, under her brother, James Taggart. However, due to James' incompetence, it is Dagny who is responsible for all the workings of the railroad.

Dagny has three romantic relationships, each with a man of ability: [[Francisco d'Anconia]], [[Hank Rearden]], and [[John Galt]]. Galt marks the pinnacle of everything Dagny seeks in the world and is the kind of man alluded to in her youth when she imagines a man standing off in the distance, at the end of a great set of railroad tracks and all her struggles.

The essential drama of Dagny's character is her struggle to reconcile the life she lives and the railroad which she loves with the moral code of those who wish to destroy it. She believes these destroyers simply want to heap burdens upon her for the sake of others, which she has the ability to carry. Like Hank, she believes they want to live, but are too stupid and incompetent to realize how their duties and altruistic projects impede that goal. It is not until she sees the man most important to her in the world - John Galt - strapped to a torture machine, about to be killed by the looters (who recognize, too, that he is the only man who can save them from economic collapse), that she realizes that the moral code of the looters is one of death: they recognize what is good and necessary for life, but wish to destroy it anyway.

She is a typical [[Randian hero]]ine, similar to [[Dominique Francon]] (''The Fountainhead'') or [[Kira Argounova]] (''We the Living'').

===John Galt===
{{Main|John Galt}}
The enigmatic John Galt is the primary male hero of ''Atlas Shrugged.'' He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental, who often dines with Eddie Willers in the employee's cafeteria, and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental. Only Eddie's side of their conversations is given in the novel. Eddie tells him which suppliers and contractors Dagny is most dependent on; these men are consistently the next to disappear. Later in the novel, the reader discovers this worker's true identity.

===Ragnar Danneskjöld===
One of the original strikers, he is now world famous as a [[pirate]]. Ragnar attended [[List of locations in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]] and became friends with John Galt and Francisco d'Anconia while studying under Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. Danneskjöld seizes relief ships that are being sent from the [[United States]] to The People's States of [[Europe]]. As the novel progresses, Danneskjöld begins to become active in American waters. Danneskjöld's action is to restore to other creative people the money, in gold, which was unjustly taken away from them—specifically, their [[income tax]] payments.  He explains this is not [[altruism]]; his motivation is to ensure that once those espousing Galt's philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society, they will have enough capital to rebuild the world.

Kept in the background for much of the book, Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance when he risks his life to meet ''Hank Rearden'' in the night and hand him a bar of gold as an &quot;advance payment&quot; to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation. Danneskjöld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world, which only knows of Ludlow as a [[film star]] who retired and dropped out of sight. It is mentioned that some of the strikers have strong reservations about his way of &quot;conducting the common struggle.&quot;

According to [[Barbara Branden]], who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written, there were sections written describing Danneskjöld's adventures at sea, which were cut from the final published text.&lt;ref&gt;Reedstrom, Karen. [http://barbarabranden.com/interview4.html 1992 Interview with Full Context]. Barbara Branden interview in ''Full Context'', October 1992. Republished on barbarabranden.com. Retrieved 1 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the published book, Danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others (Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden), except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter.

===Francisco d'Anconia===
Francisco d'Anconia is one of the central characters in ''Atlas Shrugged'', and owner by inheritance of the world's largest copper mining empire. He is a childhood friend, and the first love, of Dagny Taggart.

A child prodigy of exceptional talents, Francisco was dubbed the &quot;climax&quot; of the d'Anconia line, an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists. He attended [[List of locations in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]] and was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler. He began working at a young age, while still in school, proving that he could have made a successful career on his own merits without the aid of his family's wealth and power. 

Francisco is one of the strikers and is slowly destroying the d'Anconia empire to put it out of the raiders' reach. His actions were designed both to &quot;trap&quot; looters into relying upon his worthless ventures in order to disrupt their schemes and to try to show the inevitable consequences of looting. He adopted the persona of a worthless playboy, by which he is known to the world, as an effective cover. However, he is forced to give up Dagny, knowing that she would not be ready to join the strikers. He remains deeply in love with her throughout the book, while also being a good and loyal friend of her other two lovers, Hank Rearden and John Galt.

His full name is Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d'Anconia.

===Dr. Floyd Ferris===
Ferris is a biologist who works as &quot;co-ordinator&quot; at the State Science Institute. He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement, and publishes a book entitled ''Why Do You Think You Think?'' He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden, and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal. He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan. Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon, and is the creator of Project F, a torture machine. When John Galt is captured by the looters, Ferris uses the device on Galt, but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt. Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters.

===Wesley Mouch===
The incompetent and trecherous lobbyist  whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Later in the novel, he becomes the country's economic dictator.

===Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Rearden===
Henry (also known as &quot;Hank&quot;) is one of the central characters in ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Like many of Rand's capitalist characters, he is a self-made man. He owns the most important steel company in the United States. He invents Rearden Metal, an [[alloy]] stronger than steel (it is to steel what steel is to iron). He lives in [[Philadelphia]] with his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and his elderly mother, all of whom he supports.

Hank Rearden knows something is wrong with the world but he is unable to define the problem. His friend, Francisco d'Anconia, helps him understand and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in [[John Galt|Galt's Speech]]. Rearden also serves to illustrate Rand's [[Atlas Shrugged#Theory of sex|theory of sex]]. Lillian Rearden cannot appreciate Hank Rearden's virtues, and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex. Dagny Taggart clearly does appreciate Rearden's virtues, and this appreciation evolves into sexual desire. Rearden is torn because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct, but he responds sexually to Dagny, who represents his highest values. Rearden struggles to resolve this internal conflict, and in doing so, illustrates Rand's sexual theory.

===Lillian Rearden===
The unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden. They have been married eight years as the novel begins. Lillian is a frigid moocher who seeks to destroy her husband. She compares being Rearden's wife with owning the world's most powerful horse. Since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast, she must bridle it down to her level, even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be grievously wasted.

As her motives become more clear, Lillian is found to share the sentiments of many other moochers and their worship of destruction. Her actions are explained as the desire to destroy achievement in the false belief that such an act bestows a greatness to the destroyer equal to the accomplishment destroyed. She seeks, then, to ruin Rearden in an effort to prove her own value, but fails.

Lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is 'realistic' enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts. She indicates that she abhors Francisco d'Anconia, because she believes he is a sexual adventurer.

===James Taggart===
The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book's most important antagonist. Taggart is an expert influence peddler who is, however, incapable of making operational decisions on his own. He relies on his sister, Dagny Taggart, to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor. In a sense, he is the antithesis of Dagny.

As the novel progresses, the moral philosophy of the looters is revealed: it is a code of stagnation. The goal of this code is to not exist, to not move forward, to become a zero. Taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal. He maintains his pretense that he wants to live, and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. In the final chapters of the novel, he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect.

===Dr. Robert Stadler===
A former professor at Patrick Henry University, mentor to [[List of characters in Atlas Shrugged#Francisco d'Anconia|Francisco d'Anconia]], [[List of characters in Atlas Shrugged#John Galt|John Galt]] and [[List of characters in Atlas Shrugged#Ragnar Danneskj.C3.B6ld|Ragnar Danneskjöld]]. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: Project X. The character was, in part, modeled on [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project, and his part in the creation of [[nuclear weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;David Harriman, ''[[Journals of Ayn Rand]]'', pp. 311-344, esp. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary characters==
The following secondary characters also appear in the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Secondary characters are listed if they appear in character lists from any of the works used to establish the list of major characters above, but do not meet the criteria for &quot;major.&quot; Minor characters who are not listed in secondary works are not listed here.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Hugh Akston''' is identified as &quot;One of the last great advocates of reason.&quot; He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at [[List of locations in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]], where he taught Francisco d'Anconia, John Galt, and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He was, along with Robert Stadler, a father figure to these three. Akston's name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. He now works as a cook in a roadside diner, and proves extremely skillful at that. When Dagny tracks him down, and before she discovers his true identity, he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental.

*'''Jeff Allen''' is a tramp who stows away on a Taggart train during one of Dagny's cross-country trips. Instead of throwing him out, she allows him to ride as her guest. It is from Allen that she learns the full story behind the collapse of the Twentieth Century Motor Company, as well as a hint of John Galt's true background.

*'''Calvin Atwood''' is owner of Atwood Light and Power Company and joins the strike.

*'''Cherryl Brooks''' is a dime store shopgirl who marries James Taggart after a chance encounter in her store the night the John Galt Line was falsely deemed his greatest success.  She marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. Cherryl is at first harsh towards Dagny, having believed Jim Taggart's descriptions of his sister, until she questions employees of the railroad. Upon learning that her scorn had been misdirected, Cherryl puts off apologizing to Dagny out of shame until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to Dagny that when she married Jim, she thought he had the heroic qualities that she had looked up to - she thought she was marrying someone like Dagny. Upon realizing the nature of the moral code surrounding her, the apparent lack of escape for herself and the heroes she worships, and her unnamed desire to remove support from the machinations she abhors, Cherryl throws herself from a bridge to her death after witnessing her husband James Taggart sleeping with Lillian Rearden and after being beaten for showing James his code of death.

*'''Mayor Bascom''' is the mayor of Rome, Wisconsin, who reveals part of the history of the Twentieth Century Motor Company.

*'''Bill Brent''' is the chief dispatcher for the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental, who tries to prevent the Taggart Tunnel disaster.

*'''Dr. Blodgett''' is the scientist who pulls the lever to demonstrate Project X.

*'''Orren Boyle''' is the head of Associated Steel and a friend of James Taggart. He is an investor in the San Sebastián Mines.

*'''Laura Bradford''' is an actress and Kip Chalmers's mistress.

*'''Kip Chalmers''' is a Washington man who has decided to run for election as Legislator from California. On the way to his campaign, the Taggart Transcontinental train that is carrying him encounters a split rail, resulting in the destruction of its diesel engine. His demands lead to a coal-burning steam engine being attached to his train in its stead and used to pull it through an eight-mile tunnel. The result is the suffocation of all passengers and the destruction of the Taggart Tunnel.

*'''Emma Chalmers''', Kip Chalmers's mother, gains some influence after his death. Known as &quot;Kip's Ma,&quot; she starts a soybean-growing project in Louisiana and commandeers thousands of railcars to move the harvest. As a result, the year's wheat crop from Minnesota never reaches the rest of the country, but instead rots in storage; also, the soybean crop is lost, having been reaped too early.

*'''Dan Conway''' is the middle-aged president of the Phoenix-Durango railroad. Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows. When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is used to drive his business out of [[Colorado]], he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing.

*'''Ken Danagger''' owns Danagger Coal in Pennsylvania. He helps Hank Rearden illegally make Rearden Metal, then later decides to quit and join Galt's strike moments before Dagny arrives to persuade him otherwise.

*'''Quentin Daniels''' is an enterprising engineer hired by Dagny Taggart to reconstruct John Galt's motor. Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had. Dagny's pursuit of Quentin leads her to &quot;[[Things in Atlas Shrugged#Galt's Gulch|Galt's Gulch]]&quot;.

*'''Sebastian d'Anconia''' was the 16th (or 17th) Century founder of the d'Anconia dynasty. Escaped from [[Spain]] because of expressing his opinions too freely and coming in conflict with the [[Inquisition]], leaving behind a palace and his beloved. Started a small mine in South America, which became the beginning of a mining empire and a new fortune (and a new palace). Eventually sent for his beloved who had waited for him many years. He is the role model which Francisco d'Anconia looks to, as Dagny Taggart looks to Nathaniel Taggart. Francisco remarks that their respective ancestors would have liked each other.

*'''Balph Eubank''' is called &quot;the literary leader of the age&quot;, despite the fact that he has never sold more than three thousand copies of his books. He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to ten thousand copies.

*The '''Fishwife''' is one of the strikers, who earns her living by providing the fish for Hammond’s grocery market; she is described as having &quot;dark, disheveled hair and large eyes&quot;, and is a writer. Galt says she &quot;wouldn't be published outside. She believes that when one deals with words, one deals with the mind.&quot; According to [[Barbara Branden]] in her book ''[[The Passion of Ayn Rand]]'', &quot;The [[Fishwife]] is Ayn's [[List of Hitchcock cameo appearances|Hitchcock-like]] appearance in ''Atlas Shrugged''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Branden1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Branden|title=The passion of Ayn Rand|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B-AEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=24 October 2010|date=20 May 1986|publisher=Doubleday|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Lawrence Hammond''' runs Hammond Cars in Colorado, one of the few companies in existence that still produces top-quality vehicles. He eventually quits and joins the strike.

*'''Richard Halley''' is Dagny Taggart's favorite composer, who mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph. Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. At age 24, his opera ''[[Phaethon]]'' was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. After 19 years, Phaethon was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared.

*'''Mrs. William Hastings''' is the widow of the chief engineer at the Twentieth Century Motor Company. Her husband quit shortly after Galt did and joined the strike some years later. Her lead allows Dagny to find Hugh Akston.

*'''Dr. Thomas Hendricks''' is a famous brain surgeon who developed a new method of preventing strokes. He joined Galt's strike when the American medical system was put under government control.

*'''Tinky Holloway''' is one of the &quot;looters&quot; and is frequently referred to and quoted by other characters in the story, but he has only has one major appearance: during the Washington meeting with Hank Rearden.

*'''Lee Hunsacker''' is in charge of a company called Amalgamated Service when takes over the Twentieth Century Motor Company. He files a lawsuit that eventually leads to Midas Mulligan and Judge Narragansett joining the strike.

*'''Gwen Ives''' is Hank Rearden's secretary.

*'''Owen Kellogg''' is Assistant to the Manager of the Taggart Terminal in [[New York]]. He catches Dagny Taggart's eye as one of the few competent men on staff. After seeing the sorry state of the Ohio Division, she decides to make him its new Superintendent. However, as soon as she returns to New York, Kellogg informs her that he is quitting his job. Owen Kellogg eventually reaches, and settles in, Galt's Gulch.

*'''Fred Kinnan''' is a labor leader and member of the looter cabal. Unlike the others, however, Kinnan is straightforward and honest about his purpose. Kinnan is the only one to openly state the true motivations of himself and his fellow conspirators. At the end of Galt's 3 hour speech, he expresses admiration for the man, as he says what he means. Despite this, Kinnan admits that he is one of the people Galt is out to destroy.

*'''Paul Larkin''' is an unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family. He meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down. James Taggart knows he is friends with Hank Rearden and challenges his loyalty, and Larkin assures Taggart that he will go along with them.

*'''Eugene Lawson''' heads the Community Bank of Madison, then gets a job with the government when it &lt;!--the bank, or the government? --&gt;goes bankrupt.

*'''Mort Liddy''' is a [[hack writer|hack]] composer who writes trite scores for movies and modern symphonies to which no one listens. He believes melody is a primitive vulgarity. He is one of Lillian Rearden's friends and a member of the cultural elite.

*'''Clifton Locey''' is a friend of Jim Taggart who takes the position of vice-president of operation when Dagny Taggart quits.

*'''Pat Logan''' is the engineer on the first run of the John Galt Line. He later strikes.

*'''Kay Ludlow''' is a beautiful actress and the wife of Ragnar Danneskjöld.

*'''Dick McNamara''' is a contractor who finished the San Sebastian Line. Dagny Taggart plans to hire him to lay the new Rearden Metal track for the Rio Norte Line, but before she does so, he mysteriously disappears. She later discovers that he has joined the strike and settled in Galt's Gulch.

*'''Cuffy Meigs''' is the Director of Unification for the railroad business. He carries a pistol and a lucky rabbit's foot, and he dresses in a military uniform, and has been described as &quot;impervious to thought&quot;. Meigs seizes control of Project X and accidentally destroys it, demolishing the country's last railroad bridge across the Mississippi River and killing himself, his men, and Dr. Stadler.

*'''Dave Mitchum''' is a state-hired superintendent of the Colorado Division of Taggart Transcontinental. He is partially responsible for the Taggart Tunnel disaster.

*'''Chick Morrison''' holds the position of &quot;Morale Conditioner&quot; in the government.

*'''Horace Bussby Mowen''' is the president of the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc. of Connecticut. He is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society. Dagny Taggart hires Mowen to produce switches made of Rearden Metal. He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be cajoled into accepting the contract. When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative source.

*'''Midas Mulligan''' is a wealthy banker who mysteriously disappeared in protest after he was given a court order to lend money to an incompetent applicant. When the order came down he liquidated his entire business, paid off his depositors, and joined Galt's strike. Mulligan's birth name was Michael, but he had it legally changed after a news article called him &quot;[[Midas]]&quot; in a derogatory fashion, which Mulligan took as a compliment.

*'''Judge Narragansett''' is an American jurist who ruled in favor of Midas Mulligan during the case brought against him by the incompetent loan applicant. When Narragansett's ruling was reversed on appeal, he retired and joined the strike. At the end of the novel, he is seen editing the [[United States Constitution]], crossing out the contradicting amendments of it and adding an amendment to prohibit Congress from passing laws that restrain freedom of trade.

*'''Ben Nealy''' is a railroad contractor whom Dagny Taggart hires to replace the track on the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal. Nealy is incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country. Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power. He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement. He relies on Dagny and Ellis Wyatt to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around.

*'''Betty Pope''' is a wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with James Taggart. She is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position.

*'''Dr. Potter''' holds some undefined position with the State Science Institute. He is sent to try to obtain the rights to Rearden Metal.

*'''Dr. Simon Pritchett''' is the prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at [[List of locations in Atlas Shrugged#Patrick Henry University|Patrick Henry University]] and is considered the leading philosopher of the age. He believes that man is nothing but a collection of chemicals, reason is a superstition, it is futile to seek meaning in life, and the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood.

*'''Rearden's mother''', whose name is not mentioned, lives with Rearden at his home in [[Philadelphia]]. She is involved in charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can. She dotes on her weak son Philip Rearden.

*'''Philip Rearden''' is the younger brother of Hank Rearden. He lives in his brother's home in [[Philadelphia]] and is completely dependent on him. He is resentful of his brother's charity.

*'''Dwight Sanders''' owns Sanders Aircraft, a producer of high-quality airplanes, and joins the strike.

*'''Bertram Scudder''' is an editorial writer for the magazine ''The Future''. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on Hank Rearden called ''The Octopus''. He is also vocal in support of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.

*'''Claude Slagenhop''' is president of political organization Friends of Global Progress and one of Lillian Rearden's friends. He believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action. Global Progress is a sponsor of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill.

*'''Gerald and Ivy Starnes''' are the two surviving children of Jed Starnes; together with their since-deceased brother Eric, they instituted a communistic payment-and-benefits program at Twentieth Century Motors which drove the company into bankruptcy. Gerald, a dying alcoholic, and Ivy, a [[New Age|pseudo-Buddhist]] ascetic, continue to insist that the plan was perfect and that the failure of their father's company was entirely due to the workers.

*'''Andrew Stockton''' runs the Stockton Foundry in Stockton, Colorado. When he joins the strike, he opens a foundry in Galt's Gulch.

*'''Nathaniel Taggart''' was the founder of Taggart Transcontinental. He built his railroad without any government handouts, and ran the business for no other reason than to turn a profit. He began as a penniless adventurer and ended up as one of the wealthiest men in the country. He never earned money by force or fraud, and never apologized for becoming wealthy and successful. He was one of the most hated men of his time. Dagny is often inspired by looking at a statue of Nat Taggart at the railroad headquarters.

*'''Mr. Thompson''' is the &quot;[[Head of State|Head of the State]]&quot; for the [[United States]]. He is not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rand's notes indicate that she modeled him on President [[Harry S. Truman]].

*'''Lester Tuck''' is the press agent for Kip Chalmers.

*'''Clem Weatherby''' is a government representative on the board of directors of Taggart Transcontinental.

*The '''Wet Nurse (Tony)''' is a young bureaucrat sent by the government to watch over Rearden’s mills. Though he starts out as a cynical follower of the looters’ code, his experience at the mills transforms him, and he comes to respect and admire the producers. He is shot attempting to inform Hank Rearden about a government plot, but does succeed in warning Rearden just before he dies.

*'''Edwin &quot;Eddie&quot; Willers''' is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental. He grew up with Dagny Taggart. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and he followed in their footsteps. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. He is also secretly in love with Dagny. Willers is generally assumed to represent the common man: someone who does not possess the Promethean creative ability of The Strikers, but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. He sticks it out with the railway to the bitter end, even when the old world is obviously collapsing and Dagny has shifted her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt. In the end, he stays with the broken-down Comet in the middle of the desert, like a captain going down with his ship. It is unclear whether or not the strikers or anyone else will return to save him.

*'''Ellis Wyatt''' is the head of [[Companies in Atlas Shrugged|Wyatt Oil]]. He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of [[Colorado]] by discovering a new process for extracting more oil from what were thought to be exhausted oil wells. When first introduced, he is aggressive towards Dagny, whom he does not yet know and whom he blames for what are, in fact, her brother's policies which directly threaten his business. When the government passes laws and decrees which make it impossible for him to continue, he sets all his oil wells on fire, leaving a jeering note: &quot;I am leaving it as I found it. Take over. It's yours.&quot; One particular burning well that resists all efforts to extinguish it becomes known as &quot;Wyatt's Torch&quot;. Later Dagny meets him in Galt's Gulch.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Anthropology''' is the study of humanity. It has origins in the [[natural sciences]], the [[humanities]], and the [[social science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Eric (1994) ''Perilous Ideas: Race, Culture, People.'' ''[[Current Anthropology]]'' 35: 1-7. p.227&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;[[wiktionary:anthropology|anthropology]]&quot;, {{pron-en|ænθrɵˈpɒlədʒi}}, is from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''[[Anthropos|anthrōpos]]'' ({{lang|grc|ἄνθρωπος}}), &quot;man&quot;, and ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'' (-λογία), &quot;discourse&quot; or &quot;study&quot;, and was first used in 1501 by German philosopher [[Magnus Hundt]].&lt;ref name=Dieserud&gt;Dieserud, Juul (1908) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZcISAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=the+scope+and+content+of+the+science+of+anthropology&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Scope and Content of the Science of Anthropology]'' London:Open Court Publishing ISBN 0802139434&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropology asks &quot;What defines ''[[Homo sapiens]]''?&quot;, &quot;Who are the ancestors of modern ''Homo sapiens''?&quot;, &quot;What are humans' physical traits?&quot;, &quot;How do humans behave?&quot;, &quot;Why are there variations and differences among different groups of humans?&quot;, &quot;How has the evolutionary past of ''Homo sapiens'' influenced its social organization and culture?&quot; and so forth.

In the United States, contemporary anthropology is typically divided into four sub-fields: cultural anthropology (also called &quot;social        anthropology&quot;), archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and physical (or biological) anthropology.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaanet.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/profdev/careers/Careers.cfm AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''four-field'' approach to anthropology is reflected in many undergraduate textbooks&lt;ref&gt;(Kottak, C)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as anthropology programs (e.g. [[University of Michigan|Michigan]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]]). At universities in the [[United Kingdom]], and much of [[Europe]], these &quot;sub-fields&quot; are frequently housed in separate departments and are seen as distinct disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Layton, Robert (1998) An Introduction to Theory in Anthropology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social and cultural sub-field has been heavily influenced by [[structuralist]] and post-modern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies (an arena more typically in the remit of [[sociologist]]s). During the 1970s and 1980s there was an [[epistemological]] shift away from the [[positivist]] traditions that had largely informed the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Geertz, Behar, Clifford &amp; James&lt;/ref&gt; During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology. In contrast, archaeology, biological anthropology, and linguistic anthropology remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in [[epistemology]], anthropology as a discipline has lacked cohesion over the last several decades. This has even led to departments diverging, for example in the 1998&amp;ndash;9 academic year at Stanford University, where the &quot;scientists&quot; and &quot;non-scientists&quot; divided into two departments: anthropological sciences and cultural &amp; social anthropology;&lt;ref&gt;Stanford University Bulletin 1998-1999 pg. 213, [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002257&amp;mediaType=application/pdf Sul-derivatives.stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; these departments later reunified in the 2008&amp;ndash;9 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin_past/bulletin07-08/pdf/0708_Bulletin.pdf Stanford University Bulletin 2007-2008 pg. 269]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Anthropology is traditionally divided into four sub-fields, each with its own further branches: [[Biological anthropology|biological or physical anthropology]], [[social anthropology]] or [[cultural anthropology]], [[archaeology]] and [[linguistic anthropology|anthropological linguistics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aaanet.org&quot;/&gt; These fields frequently overlap, but tend to use different methodologies and techniques.

[[Biological anthropology]], or [[physical anthropology]], focuses on the study of human populations using an evolutionary framework. Biological anthropologists have theorized about how the globe has become populated with humans (e.g. the &quot;[[Out of Africa theory|Out Of Africa]]&quot; and &quot;[[Multiregional origin of modern humans|multi-regional evolution]]&quot; debate), as well as tried to explain geographical human variation and [[race (classification of human beings)|race]]. Many biological anthropologists studying modern human populations identify their field as [[human ecology]], itself linked to [[sociobiology]]. Human ecology uses evolutionary theory to understand phenomena among contemporary human populations. Another large sector of biological anthropology is [[primatology]], where anthropologists focus on understanding other primate populations. Methodologically, primatologists borrow heavily from field biology and ecology in their research. 

[[Cultural anthropology]] is also called socio-cultural anthropology or [[social anthropology]] (especially in the United Kingdom). It is the study of culture, and is mainly based on [[ethnography]]. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and a product of research, namely a monograph or book. Ethnography is a grounded, inductive method that heavily relies on participant-observation. [[Ethnology]] involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic point of view; which would otherwise be unattainable by simply reading from a book. In some European countries, all cultural anthropology is known as [[ethnology]] (a term coined and defined by [[Adam František Kollár|Adam F. Kollár]] in 1783).&lt;ref&gt;Han F. Vermeulen, &quot;The German Invention of ''Völkerkunde:'' Ethnological Discourse in Europe and Asia, 1740-1798.&quot; In: Sara Eigen and Mark Larrimore, eds. ''The German Invention of Race.'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of [[kinship]] and [[social organization]] is a central focus of cultural anthropology, as kinship is a [[human universal]]. Cultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization, law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology).

Archaeology is the study of human material culture, including both [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] (older pieces of human culture) carefully gathered ''in situ'', museum pieces and modern garbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913924,00.html | work=Time | title=The Nation: Truth in Garbage | date=26 January 1976 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists work closely with biological anthropologists, art historians, physics laboratories (for dating), and museums. They are charged with preserving the results of their excavations and are often found in museums. Typically, archaeologists are associated with &quot;digs,&quot; or excavation of layers of ancient sites.

Archaeologists subdivide time into cultural periods based on long-lasting artifacts: the [[Paleolithic]], the [[Neolithic]], the [[Bronze Age]], which are further subdivided according to artifact traditions and culture region, such as the [[Oldowan]] or the [[Gravettian]]. In this way, archaeologists provide a vast frame of reference for the places human beings have traveled, their ways of making a living, and their [[demographics]]. Archaeologists also investigate nutrition, symbolization, art, systems of writing, and other physical remnants of human cultural activity.

[[Linguistic anthropology]] (also called [[anthropological linguistics]]) seeks to understand the processes of human communications, verbal and non-verbal, variation in [[language]] across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture. It is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including [[sociolinguistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], [[semiotics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[narrative]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Salzmann, Zdeněk. (1993) ''Language, culture, and society: an introduction to linguistic anthropology''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic anthropology is divided into its own sub-fields: [[descriptive linguistics]] the construction of grammars and lexicons for unstudied languages; [[historical linguistics]], including the reconstruction of past languages, from which our current languages have descended; [[ethnolinguistics]], the study of the relationship between language and culture, and [[sociolinguistics]], the study of the social functions of language. Anthropological linguistics is also concerned with the evolution of the parts of the brain that deal with language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anthropology.net/2007/08/15/new-york-times-reviews-kenneallys-the-first-word/ Anthropology.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises (see [[History of Anthropology]]), including but not limited to [[Fossil collecting|fossil-hunting]], [[Exploration|exploring]], documentary film-making, [[paleontology]], [[primatology]], antiquity dealings and curatorship, [[philology]], [[etymology]], [[genetics]], regional analysis, [[ethnology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]] and [[religious studies]],&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Paul A. and Liam D. Murphy. ''A History of Anthropological Theory''. Broadview Press. 2003. p. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Stocking, &quot;Paradigmatic Traditions in the History of Anthropology.&quot; In George Stocking, The Ethnographer's Magic and Other Essays in the History of Anthropology (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1992):342-361.&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article, although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Leaf, Murray. ''Man, Mind and Science: A History of Anthropology.'' Columbia University Press. 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

On the one hand this has led to instability in many American anthropology departments, resulting in the division or reorganization of sub-fields (e.g. at Stanford, Duke, and most recently at Harvard).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2009/05.28/newdept.html News.harvard.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; However, seen in a positive light, anthropology is one of the few places in many American universities where humanities, social, and natural sciences are forced to confront one another. As such, anthropology has also been central in the development of several new (late 20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as [[cognitive science]], [[global studies]], [[human-computer interaction]], and various [[ethnic studies]].

Because of the holistic nature of anthropological research, all branches of anthropology have widespread practical application in diverse fields. This is known as [[applied anthropology]]. Thus military expeditions employ anthropologists to discern strategic cultural footholds; marketing professionals employ anthropology to determine propitious placement of advertising; and humanitarian agencies depend on anthropological insights as means to fight poverty. Examples of applied anthropology are ubiquitous.

==Basic trends==
There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more [[Holism|holistic]] account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia. 

In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard. It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.&lt;ref&gt;Rosaldo, Renato.  ''Culture and Truth: The remaking of social analysis''. Beacon Press. 1993; Inda, John Xavier and Renato Rosaldo.  ''The Anthropology of Globalization. Wiley-Blackwell. 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jurmaiine, Lynn Kiilgore, Wenda Treavathan, and Russell L. Ciochon.  ''Introduction to Physical Anthropology. 11th Edition. Wadsworth. 2007, chapters I, III and IV.''; Wompack, Mari.  ''Being Human''. Prentice Hall. 2001, pp. 11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures)&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Donald.  ''Human Universals''. McGraw Hill. 1991; Roughley, Neil.  ''Being Humans: Anthropological Universality and Particularity in Transciplinary Perspectives''. Walter de Gruyter Publishing. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  They use many different methods of study, but modern population [[genetics]], [[participant observation]] and other techniques often take anthropologists &quot;into the field&quot; which means traveling to a community in its own setting, to do something called &quot;fieldwork.&quot;  On the biological or physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs. Due to the interest in variation, anthropologists are drawn to the study of human extremes, aberrations and other unusual circumstances, such as [[headhunting]], [[whirling dervishes]], whether there were real [[Homo floresienses|Hobbit people]], [[snake handling]], and [[Glossolalia|glossolalia (speaking in tongues)]], just to list a few.

At the same time, anthropologists urge, as part of their quest for scientific objectivity, [[cultural relativism]], which has an influence on all the sub-fields of anthropology. This is the notion that particular cultures should not be judged by one culture's values or viewpoints, but that all cultures should be viewed as relative to each other. There should be no notions, in good anthropology, of one culture being better or worse than another culture.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Strauss, Claude.  ''The Savage Mind''. 1962; Womack, Mari.  ''Being Human.'' 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting [[genocide]], [[infanticide]], [[racism]], [[mutilation]] including [[circumcision]] and [[subincision]], and [[torture]]. Topics like racism, slavery or human sacrifice, therefore, attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin.  ''Cows, Pigs, Wars and Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; to genes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=209831&amp;sectioncode=26 Timeshighereducation.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; to [[acculturation]] have been proposed, not to mention theories of  [[colonialism]] and many others as root causes of [[Man's inhumanity to man]]. To illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach, one can take just one of these topics, such as &quot;racism&quot; and find thousands of anthropological references, stretching across all the major and minor sub-fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm; AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/282/5389/654?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;titleabstract=DNA+challenges+race&amp;searchid=QID_NOT_SET&amp;FIRSTINDEX=; Sciencemag.org], Shanklin, Eugenia. 1994. Anthropology &amp; Race; Faye V. Harrison. 1995. &quot;The Persistent Power of 'Race' in the Cultural and Political Economy of Racism.&quot; Annual Review of Anthropology. 24:47-74. Allan Goodman. 1995. &quot;The Problematics of &quot;Race&quot; in Contemporary Biological Anthropology.&quot; In Biological Anthropology: The State of the Science.; Yearbook of Physical Anthropology, 1945-.  &quot;Melanin, Afrocentricity...,&quot; 36(1993):33-58.; see Stanford's recent collection of overarching bibliographies on race and racism, [http://library.stanford.edu/depts/ssrg/misc/race.html Library.stanford.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis, anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material, such as the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]], of particular use in archaeology. Further cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as [[Olduwan]] or [[Mousterian]] or [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past. Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to [[Culture regions]] as well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of [[comparative method]], a central part of their science.

Contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges. The single largest organization of Anthropologists is the [[American Anthropological Association]], which was founded in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/about/ AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Membership is made up of Anthropologists from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/membership/upload/MAY-08-AAA.pdf AAAnet.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub-fields of anthropology, sometimes divided up by nation or region, and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[physics]], [[zoology]], [[paleontology]], [[anatomy]], [[music theory]], [[art history]], [[sociology]] and so on, belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well.&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, Donald and Kate Wong.

==History==
{{Main|History of anthropology}}
The first use of the term &quot;anthropology&quot; in English to refer to a natural science of humanity was apparently in 1593, the first of the &quot;[[-logy|logies]]&quot; to be coined.&lt;ref&gt;Urbanowicz, Charles. In the Newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, reprinted online, [http://www.csuchico.edu/~curbanowicz/Pub_Papers/4field.html Csuchico.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; It took [[Immanuel Kant]] 25 years to write one of the first major treatises on anthropology, his ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View''.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel.  &quot;Introduction&quot; to his 1961 translation of Kant's work, reprinted, [http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpfoucault1.htm Generation-online.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  Kant is not generally considered to be a modern anthropologist, however, as he never left his region of Germany nor did he study any cultures besides his own, and in fact, describes the need for anthropology as a corollary field to his own primary field of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Brian, and Kain, Patrick (eds.), Essays on Kant's Anthropology, Cambridge University Press, 2003, 278pp., ISBN 0521790387.&lt;/ref&gt;  He did, however, begin teaching an annual course in anthropology in 1772. Anthropology is thus primarily an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] endeavor.

Historians of anthropology, like Marvin Harris,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Marvin.  ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory.''  Alta Mira Press. 2000 (revised from 1968); Harris, Marvin.  ''Theories of Culture in Postmodern Times. Altamira. 1998''&lt;/ref&gt; indicate two major frameworks within which empirical anthropology has arisen: interest in comparisons of people over space and interest in longterm human processes or humans as viewed through time. Harris dates both to [[Classical Greece]] and [[Classical Rome]], specifically [[Herodotus]], often called the &quot;father of history&quot; and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian [[Tacitus]], who wrote many of our only surviving contemporary accounts of several ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples]]. Herodotus first formulated some of the persisting problems of anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 1968, op cit. pp. 8-52; Leaf 1970, op cit. pp. 1-13; Erickson and Murph, 2003, pp. 21-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval scholars may be considered forerunners of modern anthropology as well, insofar as they conducted or wrote detailed studies of the customs of peoples considered &quot;different&quot; from themselves in terms of geography.  [[John of Plano Carpini]] reported of his stay among the [[Mongols]]. His report was unusual in its detailed depiction of a non-European culture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/Publications/Source_pages/AnthroHist.htm Resources for a History of Anthropology]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marco Polo]]'s systematic observations of nature, anthropology, and geography are another example of studying human variation across space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tk421.net/essays/polo.html Marco Polo's Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; Polo's travels took him across such a diverse human landscape and his accounts of the peoples he met as he journeyed were so detailed that they earned for Polo the name &quot;the father of modern anthropology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/011rowe.pdf The Renaissance Foundations of Anthropology]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another candidate for one of the first scholars to carry out comparative ethnographic-type studies in person was the medieval [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] in the 11th century, who wrote about the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive [[participant observation]] with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, and presented his findings with [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]] using [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]].&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ahmed | first1 = Akbar S. | year = 1984 | title = Al-Beruni: The First Anthropologist | url = | journal = RAIN | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 9–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that he can hardly be considered an anthropologist in the conventional sense.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tapper (1995). &quot;Islamic Anthropology&quot; and the &quot;Anthropology of Islam&quot;, ''Anthropological Quarterly'' '''68''' (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote detailed comparative studies on the religions and cultures in the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and especially [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1353/jhi.1998.0030 | last1 = Walbridge | first1 = J.

Most scholars{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} consider modern anthropology as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], a period when Europeans attempted systematically to study human behavior, the known varieties of which had been increasing since the 15th century as a result of the [[first European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|first European colonization wave]]. The traditions of [[jurisprudence]], [[history]], [[philology]], and [[sociology]] then evolved into something more closely resembling the modern views of these disciplines and informed the development of the [[social sciences]], of which anthropology was a part.

Developments in the systematic study of ancient civilizations through the disciplines of [[Classics]] and [[Egyptology]] informed both archaeology and eventually social anthropology, as did the study of East and South Asian languages and cultures. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers, such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], whose work formed the basis for the &quot;culture concept,&quot; which is central to the discipline.
[[File:Table of Natural History, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Table of natural history, 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia]]'']]

Institutionally, anthropology emerged from the development of [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]) that occurred during the European colonization of the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Programs of ethnographic study originated in this era as the study of the &quot;human primitives&quot; overseen by colonial administrations.

There was a tendency in late 18th century Enlightenment thought to understand human society as natural phenomena that behaved according to certain principles and that could be observed empirically. In some ways, studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was not unlike studying the flora and fauna of those places.

Early anthropology was divided between proponents of [[unilineal evolution|unilinealism]], who argued that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process, from the most primitive to the most advanced, and various forms of non-lineal theorists, who tended to subscribe to ideas such as [[diffusionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Most 19th-century social theorists, including anthropologists, viewed non-European societies as windows onto the pre-industrial human past.

As academic disciplines began to differentiate over the course of the 19th century, anthropology grew increasingly distinct from the biological approach of natural history, on the one hand, and from purely historical or literary fields such as Classics, on the other. A common criticism has been that many social science scholars (such as economists, sociologists, and psychologists) in Western countries focus disproportionately on Western subjects, while anthropology focuses disproportionately on the &quot;Other&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; this has changed over the last part of the 20th century as anthropologists increasingly also study Western subjects, particularly variation across class, region, or ethnicity within Western societies, and other social scientists increasingly take a global view of their fields.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains. The natural and biological ''[[sciences]]'' seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments. The ''[[humanities]]'' generally study local traditions, through their [[history]], [[literature]], [[music]], and [[art]]s, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras.

The ''[[social sciences]]'' have generally attempted to develop [[scientific method]]s to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences. In particular, social sciences often develop [[statistics|statistical]] descriptions rather than the general laws derived in [[physics]] or [[chemistry]], or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of [[psychology]]. Anthropology (like some fields of [[history]]) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/375868 | last1 = Wallerstein | first1 = Immanuel | year = 2003 | title = Anthropology, sociology, and other dubious disciplines | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 453–466 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropology as it emerged amongst the Western colonial powers (mentioned above) has generally taken a different path than that in the countries of southern and central Europe ([[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the successors to the [[Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman empire]]s). In the former, the encounter with multiple, distinct cultures, often very different in organization and language from those of Europe, has led to a continuing emphasis on [[cross-cultural comparison]] and a receptiveness to certain kinds of cultural relativism.&lt;ref&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) &quot;Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason,&quot; in ''Culture and Human Nature: theoretical papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp. 32-58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the successor states of continental Europe, on the other hand, anthropologists often joined with folklorists and linguists in building nationalist perspectives. Ethnologists in these countries tended to focus on differentiating among local ethnolinguistic groups, documenting local folk culture, and representing the prehistory of what has become a nation through various forms of public education (eg, museums of several kinds).&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest. (1998) ''Language and solitude: Wittgenstein, Malinowski, and the Habsburg dilemma''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scheme, Russia occupied a middle position. On the one hand, it had a large region (largely east of the Urals) of highly distinct, pre-industrial, often non-literate peoples, similar to the situation in the Americas. On the other hand, Russia also participated to some degree in the nationalist (cultural and political) movements of Central and Eastern Europe. After the Revolution of 1917, anthropology in the USSR, and later the Soviet Bloc countries, were highly shaped by the requirement to conform to Marxist theories of social evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest, ed. (1980) ''Soviet and Western anthropology''. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries==
===Britain===
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|right|[[E. B. Tylor]], 19th-century British anthropologist.]]
[[Edward Burnett Tylor|E. B. Tylor]] ( 2 October 1832 – 2 January 1917) and [[James Frazer|James George Frazer]] ( 1 January 1854 – 7 May 1941) are generally considered the antecedents to modern [[social anthropology]] in Britain. Though Tylor undertook a field trip to [[Mexico]], both he and Frazer derived most of the material for their comparative studies through extensive reading, not fieldwork, mainly the Classics (literature and history of Greece and Rome), the work of the early European folklorists, and reports from missionaries, travelers, and contemporaneous ethnologists.

Tylor advocated strongly for unilinealism and a form of &quot;uniformity of mankind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf Stocking, George Jr. (1963) &quot;Matthew Arnold, E. B. Tylor, and the Uses of Invention,&quot; ''American Anthropologist'', 65:783-799, 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; Tylor in particular laid the groundwork for theories of [[cultural diffusionism]], stating that there are three ways that different groups can have similar cultural forms or technologies: &quot;independent invention, inheritance from ancestors in a distant region, transmission from one race [sic] to another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1865) ''Researches into the early history of mankind the development of civilization.'' London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor formulated one of the early and influential anthropological conceptions of [[culture]] as &quot;that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1871) ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom''. 2 vols. London, John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Stocking notes, Tylor mainly concerned himself with describing and mapping the distribution of particular elements of culture, rather than with the larger function, and generally seemed to assume a Victorian idea of progress rather than the idea of non-directional, multilineal cultural development proposed by later anthropologists.

Tylor also theorized about the origins of religious feelings in human beings, proposing a theory of [[animism]] as the earliest stage, and noting that &quot;religion&quot; has many components, of which he believed the most important to be belief in supernatural beings (as opposed to moral systems, cosmology, etc.). Frazer, a Scottish scholar with a broad knowledge of Classics, also concerned himself with religion, myth, and magic. His comparative studies, most influentially in the numerous editions of ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', analyzed similarities in religious belief and symbolism globally.

Neither Tylor nor Frazer, however, were particularly interested in [[fieldwork]], nor were they interested in examining how the cultural elements and institutions fit together. Toward the turn of the 20th century, a number of anthropologists became dissatisfied with this categorization of cultural elements; historical reconstructions also came to seem increasingly speculative.

Under the influence of several younger scholars, a new approach came to predominate among British anthropologists, concerned with analyzing how societies held together in the present ([[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] analysis, rather than [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] or historical analysis), and emphasizing long-term (one to several years) immersion fieldwork. [[Cambridge University]] financed a [[William Rivers#Torres Straits Expedition|multidisciplinary expedition]] to the [[Torres Strait Islands]] in 1898, organized by [[Alfred Court Haddon]] and including a physician-anthropologist, [[William Rivers]], as well as a linguist, a botanist, other specialists. The findings of the expedition set new standards for ethnographic description.

A decade and a half later, Polish anthropology student [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942) was beginning what he expected to be a brief period of [[fieldwork]] in the old model, collecting lists of cultural items, when the outbreak of the First World War stranded him in [[New Guinea]]. As a subject of the Austro-Hungarian Empire resident on a British colonial possession, he was effectively confined to New Guinea for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronisław (1967) ''A diary in the strict sense of the term''. New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; World [1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

He made use of the time by undertaking far more intensive fieldwork than had been done by ''British'' anthropologists, and his classic ethnography, ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922) advocated an approach to [[fieldwork]] that became standard in the field: getting &quot;the native's point of view&quot; through [[participant observation]]. Theoretically, he advocated a [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalist]] interpretation, which examined how social institutions functioned to satisfy individual needs.

British social anthropology had an expansive moment in the [[Interwar period]], with key contributions coming from the Polish-British [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Meyer Fortes]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (1995) ''[http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 The Expansive Moment: The Rise of Social Anthropology in Britain and Africa, 1918-1970]'' review at [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0094-0496(199702)24%3A1%3C211%3ATEMTRO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-I Links.jstor.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] also published a seminal work in 1922. He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the [[Andaman Islands]] in the old style of historical reconstruction. However, after reading the work of French sociologists [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], Radcliffe-Brown published an account of his research (entitled simply ''The Andaman Islanders'') that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths. Over time, he developed an approach known as [[structural functionalism|structural-functionalism]], which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. (This contrasted with Malinowski's functionalism, and was quite different from the later French [[Structuralism#Structuralism in anthropology and sociology|structuralism]], which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism.)

Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown's influence stemmed from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions that furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for &quot;Social Anthropology&quot; by teaching at universities across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. From the late 1930s until the postwar period appeared a string of monographs and edited volumes that cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology (BSA). Famous ethnographies include ''The Nuer,'' by [[Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]], and ''The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi,'' by [[Meyer Fortes]]; well-known edited volumes include ''African Systems of Kinship and Marriage'' and ''African Political Systems.''

[[Max Gluckman]], together with many of his colleagues at the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] and students at [[Manchester University]], collectively known as the [[Manchester School (anthropology)|Manchester School]], took BSA in new directions through their introduction of explicitly Marxist-informed theory, their emphasis on conflicts and conflict resolution, and their attention to the ways in which individuals negotiate and make use of the social structural possibilities.

In Britain, anthropology had a great intellectual impact, it &quot;contributed to the erosion of [[Christianity]], the growth of [[cultural relativism]], an awareness of the survival of the primitive in modern life, and the replacement of [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] modes of analysis with [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]], all of which are central to modern culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Heyck at [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8762%28199712%29102%3A5%3C1486%3AATBSA1%3E2.0.CO%3B2-7 Links.jstor.org] The American Historical Review, Vol. 102, No. 5 (December, 1997), pp. 1486-1488 doi:10.2307/2171126&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 1960s and 1970s, [[Edmund Leach]] and his students [[Mary Douglas]] and [[Nur Yalman]], among others, introduced French structuralism in the style of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]; while British anthropology has continued to emphasize social organization and economics over purely symbolic or literary topics, differences among British, French, and American sociocultural anthropologies have diminished with increasing dialogue and borrowing of both theory and methods. Today, social anthropology in Britain engages internationally with many other social theories and has branched in many directions.

In countries of the British Commonwealth, social anthropology has often been institutionally separate from [[physical anthropology]] and [[primatology]], which may be connected with departments of biology or zoology; and from archaeology, which may be connected with departments of [[Classics]], [[Egyptology]], and the like. In other countries (and in some, particularly smaller, British and North American universities), anthropologists have also found themselves institutionally linked with scholars of [[folklore]], [[Museology|museum studies]], [[human geography]], [[sociology]], [[social relations]], [[ethnic studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[social work]].

Anthropology has been used in Britain to provide an alternative explanation for the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]] to the technical explanations rooted in economic and political theory. Dr. [[Gillian Tett]], a [[Cambridge University]] trained anthropologist who went on to become a senior editor at the [[Financial Times]] is one of the leaders in this use of anthropology.

===United States===
====19th Century to 1940s====
From its beginnings in the early 19th century through the early 20th century, anthropology in the United States was influenced by the presence of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] societies.

[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franz Boas]], one of the pioneers of modern anthropology, often called the &quot;Father of American Anthropology&quot;]]
[[Cultural anthropology]] in the United States was influenced greatly by the ready availability of Native American societies as ethnographic subjects. The field was pioneered by staff of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the Smithsonian Institution's [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], men such as [[John Wesley Powell]] and [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]].

[[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881), a lawyer from [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York]], became an advocate for and ethnological scholar of the [[Iroquois]]. His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology. Like other scholars of his day (such as [[Edward Tylor]]), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from ''savagery'', to ''barbarism'', to ''civilization''. Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale.

====Boasian anthropology====
[[Franz Boas]] established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to this sort of evolutionary perspective. His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws. For example, Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature.

Influenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct ''cultures,'' rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little &quot;civilization&quot; they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the [[natural science]]s, were not possible.

In doing so, he fought discrimination against immigrants, blacks, and indigenous peoples of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) ''Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology''. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many American anthropologists adopted his agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular subjects for anthropologists today. The so-called &quot;Four Field Approach&quot; has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and archaic anthropology (e.g. archaeology). Anthropology in the United States continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture.
[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|[[Ruth Benedict]] in 1937]]

Boas used his positions at [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages helped establish [[linguistics]] as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on [[Indo-European languages]].

The publication of [[Alfred Kroeber]]'s textbook, ''Anthropology,'' marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists including [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up.

Though such works as ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' and ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by [[Ralph Linton]], and Mead was limited to her offices at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]].

===Canada===
Canadian anthropology began, as in other parts of the Colonial world, as ethnological data in the records of travellers and missionaries. In Canada, [[Jesuit]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] such as Fathers LeClercq, Le Jeune and Sagard, in the 17th century, provide the oldest ethnographic records of native tribes in what was then the Domain of Canada.

True anthropology began with a [[Government agency|Government department]]: the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], and [[George Mercer Dawson]] (director in 1895). Dawson's support for anthropology created impetus for the profession in Canada. This was expanded upon by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who established a Division of Anthropology within the Geological Survey in 1910. Anthropologists were recruited from England and the USA, setting the foundation for the unique Canadian style of anthropology. Scholars include the linguist and Boasian [[Edward Sapir]].

===France===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
Anthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions, in part because many French writers influential in anthropology have been trained or held faculty positions in sociology, philosophy, or other fields rather than in anthropology.

Most commentators consider [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872–1950), nephew of the influential sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss belonged to Durkheim's [[Année Sociologique]] group; and while Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Robert Hertz]]) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies which were not as 'differentiated' as European nation states.

Two works by Mauss in particular proved to have enduring relevance: ''[[The Gift (book)|Essay on the Gift]]'' a seminal analysis of [[trade|exchange]] and [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], and his Huxley lecture on the notion of the person, the first comparative study of notions of person and selfhood cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;Mauss, Marcel (1938) &quot;A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self.,&quot; in M. Carrithers, S. Collins, and S. Lukes, eds. ''The Category of the Person: anthropology, philosophy, history''. Pp. 1-25. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press. Originally given as &quot;Une categorie de l'Esprit Humain: La Notion de Personne, Celle de 'Moi',&quot; for the Huxley Memorial Lecture and appeared in the ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as [[surrealism]] and [[primitivism (art movement)|primitivism]] which drew on ethnography for inspiration. [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Michel Leiris]] are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as ''ethnologie'' was restricted to museums, such as the [[Musée de l'Homme]] founded by [[Paul Rivet]], and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of [[folklore]].

Above all, however, it was [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] who helped institutionalize anthropology in France. Along with the enormous influence his [[structuralism]] exerted across multiple disciplines, Lévi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology while training influential students such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Françoise Héritier]] who would prove influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France's anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally funded research laboratories ([[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]) rather than academic departments in universities.

Other influential writers in the 1970s include [[Pierre Clastres]], who explains in his books on the [[Guayaki]] tribe in [[Paraguay]] that &quot;primitive societies&quot; actively oppose the institution of the [[state (polity)|state]]. Therefore, these stateless societies are not less evolved than societies with states, but took the active choice of conjuring the institution of [[authority]] as a separate function from society. The [[Leadership|leader]] is only a spokesperson for the group when it has to deal with other groups (&quot;international relations&quot;) but has no inside authority, and may be violently removed if he attempts to abuse this position.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew Dean “Critical Re-vision: Clastres' Chronicle and the optic of [[primitivism]]”, 2002 In ''Best of Anthropology Today, 1974-2000'', ed. J. Benthall, with a preface by M. Sahlins. London: Routledge. [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0415262550 Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important French social theorist since [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and Lévi-Strauss is [[Pierre Bourdieu]], who trained formally in philosophy and sociology and eventually held the Chair of Sociology at the Collège de France. Like Mauss and others before him, however, he worked on topics both in sociology and anthropology. His fieldwork among the Kabyles of Algeria places him solidly in anthropology, while his analysis of the function and reproduction of fashion and cultural capital in European societies places him as solidly in sociology.

==Post-World War II==
Before [[World War II|WWII]] British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.

In the 1950s and mid-1960s anthropology tended increasingly to model itself after the [[natural science]]s. Some anthropologists, such as [[Lloyd Fallers]] and [[Clifford Geertz]], focused on processes of modernization by which newly independent states could develop. Others, such as [[Julian Steward]] and [[Leslie White]], focused on how societies evolve and fit their ecological niche—an approach popularized by [[Marvin Harris]].

[[Economic anthropology]] as influenced by [[Karl Polanyi]] and practiced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[George Dalton]] challenged standard neoclassical [[economics]] to take account of cultural and social factors, and employed Marxian analysis into anthropological study. In England, British Social Anthropology's paradigm began to fragment as [[Max Gluckman]] and [[Peter Worsley]] experimented with Marxism and authors such as [[Rodney Needham]] and [[Edmund Leach]] incorporated Lévi-Strauss's structuralism into their work.

Structuralism also influenced a number of developments in 1960s and 1970s, including [[Psychological anthropology#Cognitive Anthropology|cognitive anthropology]] and componential analysis. Authors such as [[David Schneider (anthropologist)|David Schneider]], [[Clifford Geertz]], and [[Marshall Sahlins]] developed a more fleshed-out concept of culture as a web of meaning or signification, which proved very popular within and beyond the discipline. In keeping with the times, much of anthropology became politicized through the [[Algerian War of Independence]] and opposition to the [[Vietnam War]];&lt;ref&gt;Fanon, Frantz. (1963) The Wretched of the Earth, transl. Constance Farrington. New York, Grove Weidenfeld.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxism]] became an increasingly popular theoretical approach in the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, Stephen ''[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/article?title=anthropology&amp;title_type=tka&amp;year_from=1998&amp;year_to=2007&amp;database=1&amp;pageSize=20&amp;index=4 Some reflections on anthropological structural Marxism]'' The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Volume 13, Number 2, June 2007, pp. 419-431(13)&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s the authors of volumes such as ''Reinventing Anthropology'' worried about anthropology's relevance.

Since the 1980s issues of power, such as those examined in [[Eric Wolf]]'s ''[[Europe and the People Without History]]'', have been central to the discipline. In the 80s books like ''Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter'' pondered anthropology's ties to colonial inequality, while the immense popularity of theorists such as [[Antonio Gramsci]] and [[Michel Foucault]] moved issues of power and [[hegemony]] into the spotlight. Gender and sexuality became popular topics, as did the relationship between history and anthropology, influenced by [[Marshall Sahlins]] (again), who drew on [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Fernand Braudel]] to examine the relationship between social structure and individual agency. Also influential in these issues were [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], the critical theory of the [[Frankfurt School]], [[Derrida]] and [[Lacan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;Lewis, Herbert S. (1998) ''[http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7294(199809)2%3A100%3A3%3C716%3ATMOAAI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-3 The Misrepresentation of Anthropology and its Consequences]'' ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 100:&quot; 716-731&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s and 1990s authors such as [[George Marcus]] and [[James Clifford]] pondered ethnographic authority, particularly how and why anthropological knowledge was possible and authoritative. They were reflecting trends in research and discourse initiated by Feminists in the academy, although they excused themselves from commenting specifically on those pioneering critics.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) ''Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography''. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, key aspects of feminist theorizing and methods became ''de rigueur'' as part of the 'post-modern moment' in anthropology: Ethnographies became more reflexive, explicitly addressing the author's methodology, cultural, gender and racial positioning, and their influence on his or her ethnographic analysis. This was part of a more general trend of [[postmodernism]] that was popular contemporaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion. London/New York: Routledge. Pp: 26-50&lt;/ref&gt; Currently anthropologists pay attention to a wide variety of issues pertaining to the contemporary world, including [[globalization]], [[medicine]] and [[biotechnology]], [[indigenous rights]], [[virtual communities]], and the anthropology of [[industrial society|industrialized societies]].

==Controversies about its history==
Anthropologists, like other researchers (especially historians and scientists engaged in field research), have over time assisted state policies and projects, especially colonialism.&lt;ref name = &quot;pbuteh&quot;&gt;Asad, Talal, ed. (1973) Anthropology &amp; the Colonial Encounter. Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Breman, Jan, and Akitoshi Shimizu (1999) ''Anthropology and Colonialism in Asia and Oceania''. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have contended:

*That the discipline grew out of colonialism, perhaps was in league with it, and derived some of its key notions from it, consciously or not.   (See, for example, Gough, Pels and Salemink, but cf. Lewis 2004).&lt;ref name=Gellner&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1992) ''Postmodernism, Reason, and Religion''. London/New York: Routledge. Pp: 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
*That ethnographic work was often [[Ahistoricism|ahistorical]], writing about people as if they were &quot;out of time&quot; in an &quot;ethnographic present&quot; ([[Johannes Fabian]], ''Time and Its Other'').

===Military===
Anthropologists' involvement with the U.S. government, in particular, has caused bitter controversy within the discipline. Franz Boas publicly objected to US participation in [[World War I]], and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several American archaeologists in espionage in Mexico under their cover as scientists.

But by the 1940s, many of Boas' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the &quot;Axis&quot; (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan). Many served in the armed forces, while others worked in intelligence (for example, [[Office of Strategic Services]] and the [[Office of War Information]]). At the same time, [[David H. Price]]'s work on American anthropology during the Cold War provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies.

Attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the CIA and government intelligence activities during the Vietnam War years have turned up surprisingly little (although anthropologist Hugo Nutini was active in the stillborn [[Project Camelot]]).&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz, Lewis ed.(1967) The Rise and Fall of Project Camelot.&lt;/ref&gt; Many anthropologists (students and teachers) were active in the antiwar movement and a great many resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA).

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The [[Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth]] (ASA) has called certain scholarships ethically dangerous. The AAA's current 'Statement of Professional Responsibility' clearly states that &quot;in relation with their own government and with host governments ... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.&quot;

However, anthropologists, along with other social scientists, are working with the US military as part of the US Army's strategy in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm CSmonitor.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian Science Monitor]] reports that &quot;Counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs&quot; in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|in Afghanistan]], under the ''[[Human Terrain System]]'' (HTS) program; additionally, HTS teams are working with the [[US military in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/professionalwriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html Army.mil]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major discussions==
===Focus on other cultures===&lt;!-- title wikilinked from [[Urban anthropology]] --&gt;
Some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of &quot;other cultures&quot;, both in terms of time (past societies) and space (non-European/non-[[Western world|Western]] societies).&lt;ref&gt;See the many essays relating to this in Prem Poddar and David Johnson, Historical Companion to Postcolonial Thought in English, Edinburgh Univeristy Press, 2004. See also Prem Poddar et al , Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures--Continental Europe and its Empires, Edinburgh University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the classic of [[urban anthropology]], [[Ulf Hannerz]] in the introduction to his seminal ''Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology'' mentions that the &quot;[[Third World]]&quot; had habitually received most of attention; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in &quot;other cultures&quot; looked for them far away and started to look &quot;across the tracks&quot; only in late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulf Hannerz]] (1980) &quot;Exploring the City: Inquiries Toward an Urban Anthropology&quot;, ISBN 0231083769, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the author's &quot;home&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot; /&gt; It is also argued that other fields of study, like [[History]] and [[Sociology]], on the contrary focus disproportionately on the West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (2007) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=jo1UVi48KywC The Theft of History]'' Cambridge University Press ISBN 0521870690&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the study of existing contemporary society has been traditionally left to [[sociologist]]s, but this is increasingly changing,&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite journal | last1 = Abélès | first1 = Marc | year = | title = How the Anthropology of France Has Changed Anthropology in France: Assessing New Directions in the Field | url = http://www.jstor.org/view/08867356/ap020057/02a00050/3?frame=noframe | journal = [[Cultural Anthropology]] | volume = 1999 | issue = | page = 407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starting in the 1970s from scholars like [[Isac Chiva]] and journals like ''[[Terrain (journal)|Terrain]]'' (&quot;fieldwork&quot;), and developing with the center founded by [[Marc Augé]] (''[[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|Le Centre d'anthropologie des mondes contemporains]]'', the Anthropological Research Center of Contemporary Societies). The same approach of focusing on &quot;modern world&quot; topics by ''Terrain'', was also present in the British [[Manchester School (anthropology)|Manchester School]] of the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

'''Agricultural science''' is a broad multidisciplinary field that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and [[social sciences]] that are used in the practice and understanding of [[agriculture]]. ([[veterinary medicine|Veterinary science]], but not [[animal science]], is often excluded from the definition.)

==Agriculture and agricultural science==

The two terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:
*[[Agriculture]] is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.
*[[Agronomy]] is [[research and development]] related to studying and improving plant-based agriculture.

Agricultural sciences include research and development on:
* Production techniques (e.g., [[irrigation]] management, recommended [[nitrogen]] inputs)
* Improving [[agricultural productivity]] in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of [[drought]]-resistant crops and animals, development of new [[pesticide]]s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro [[cell culture]] techniques)
* Transformation of primary products into end-[[consumer]] products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of [[dairy product]]s)
* Prevention and correction of adverse

==Agricultural science: a local science==

With the exception of [[theoretical production ecology|theoretical agronomy]], research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of [[ecoregions]], because it is closely linked to soil properties and [[climate]], which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, [[soil]] characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.

==History of agricultural science==
{{Main|History of agricultural science}}

Agricultural science began with [[Gregor Mendel]]'s genetic work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the [[chemical fertilizer]] outputs of [[plant physiology|plant physiological]] understanding in eighteenth century [[Germany]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch Act]] of 1887, which used the term &quot;agricultural science&quot;. The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.&lt;ref&gt;Hillison J. (1996). [http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol37/37-04-08.pdf The Origins of Agriscience: Or Where Did All That Scientific Agriculture Come From?]. ''Journal of Agricultural Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.&lt;ref name=ScienceForAg&gt;Huffman WE, Evenson RE. (2006). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWcolrGftT0C Science for Agriculture]''. [[Blackwell Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and [[developing countries]], often referred to as the [[Green Revolution]], was closely tied to progress made in  selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide|phytosanitary product]]s.

As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact  of agriculture in general and more recently [[intensive agriculture]], industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields  that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as [[integrated pest management]], [[waste management|waste treatment]] technologies, [[landscape architecture]], [[genomics]], and [[agricultural philosophy]] fields that include references to [[food industry|food production]] as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.

New technologies, such as [[biotechnology]] and [[computer science]] (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including [[genetic engineering]], [[agrophysics]], improved [[statistics|statistical analysis]], and [[precision farming]]. Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of [[history of agriculture|traditional agriculture]], including interaction of [[Religion and Agriculture|religion and agriculture]], and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.

==Agricultural science and agriculture crisis==
Agriculture sciences seek to feed the world's population while preventing [[biosafety]] problems that may affect human health and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. This requires promoting good management of [[natural resources]] and respect for the environment, and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system.

Economic, environmental, and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate. Recent crises (such as avian influenza, [[Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] and issues such as the use of [[genetically modified organism]]s) illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate.

'''Alchemy''' refers to a medieval quest for an elixir or ''kimia'' ([[Old Persian]] word for such an elixir, the concept for which was later arabicized as the word alchemy) capable of turning copper and other [[base metal]]s to gold. Alchemy is both a [[philosophy]] and an ancient [[practice]] focused on the attempt to accomplish this transmutation, investigating the preparation of the &quot;elixir of longevity&quot;, and achieving ultimate [[wisdom]], involving the improvement of the alchemist as well as the making of several substances described as possessing unusual properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/alchemy alchemy: Definition from Answers.com]. Retrieved 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The practical aspect of alchemy can be viewed as a [[protoscience]], having generated the basics of modern [[inorganic chemistry]], namely concerning procedures, equipment and the identification and use of many current substances.

Alchemy has been practiced primarily in medieval [[Iran]] as well as [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, [[Rasayana|India]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, [[Chinese alchemy|China]], [[Japan]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, [[Korea]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, the [[Classical Antiquity|classical]] [[Greco-Roman world]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, the [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic world]], and then [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] up to the modern era, in a complex [[Social network|network]] of schools and philosophical systems spanning at least 2,500 years.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==Etymology==
{{Main|Chemistry (etymology)}}
The word alchemy derives from the [[Old French]] ''alquimie'', which is from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''alchimia'', from the [[Arabic]] ''al-kimia'' (الكيمياء), in turn from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''kimia'' (Elixir). This term itself is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''chemeia'' (χημεία)&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0017630#DWS-M_EN_GB-037342 alchemy], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; with the addition of the Arabic [[definite article]] ''[[al-]]'' (الـ‎).&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|alchemy}} Or see {{OEtymD|alchemy|accessdate=2010-04-07}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek word was originally derived in its turn from &quot;Chemia&quot; (Χημία),&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the etymology for χημεία in {{Cite book| edition = Eighth edition, revised throughout| publisher = Clarendon Press| last = Liddell| first = Henry George| coauthors = Robert Scott| title = A Greek-English Lexicon| location = Oxford| year = 1901| isbn = 0199102058}}&lt;/ref&gt; a version of the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name for Egypt, which was itself based on the Ancient Egyptian word ''kēme'' (hieroglyphic Khmi, ''black earth'', as opposed to desert sand).&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;  The word could have originally derived from ''chumeia'' (χυμεία) meaning &quot;mixture&quot; and referring to [[pharmaceutical chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, both the etymology given in the Oxford English Dictionary and also that for The secret for turning metal into gold has been discovered! Meet a guy named Thorton in a pub in London,England named The Maclaver χυμεία in {{Cite book| edition = A new edition, revised and augmented throughout| publisher = Clarendon Press| last = Liddell| first = Henry George| coauthors = Robert Scott, Henry Stuart Jones| title = A Greek-English Lexicon| location = Oxford| year = 1940|url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=xumeia&amp;la=greek#lexicon| isbn = 0199102058}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the later rise of alchemy in Alexandria, the word may have derived from Χημία, and thus became spelled as χημεία, and the original meaning forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;The original source for this analysis is the article on pp.&amp;nbsp;81&amp;ndash;85 of {{Cite book| publisher = F.

==Alchemy as a philosophical and spiritual discipline==
[[File:Raimundus Lullus alchemic page.jpg|thumb|right|Page from alchemic treatise of [[Ramon Llull]], 16th century]]

Alchemy became known as the ''spagyric art'' after Greek words meaning ''to separate'' and ''to join together'' in the 16th century, the word probably being coined by [[Paracelsus]]. Compare this with one of the [[dictum]]s of Alchemy in Latin: [[Solve et Coagula]]&amp;nbsp;— ''Separate, and Join Together'' (or ''&quot;dissolve and coagulate&quot;'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.techgnosis.com/gaiman.html |title = The Gods of the Funny Books: An Interview with Neil Gaiman and Rachel Pollack |accessdate = 2007-02-04 |last = Davis |first = Erik |publisher = Techgnosis (reprint from Summer 1994 issue) |work=[[Gnosis (magazine)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-known goals of the [[List of alchemists|alchemist]]s were the [[wiktionary:transmutation|transmutation]] of common metals into [[gold]] (called [[chrysopoeia]]) or [[silver]] (less well known is plant alchemy, or &quot;[[spagyric]]&quot;); the creation of a &quot;[[panacea (medicine)|panacea]]&quot;, or the [[elixir of life]], a remedy that, it was supposed, would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely; and the discovery of a [[Alkahest|universal solvent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alchemy Alchemy at Dictionary.com].&lt;/ref&gt; Although these were not the only uses for the discipline, they were the ones most documented and well-known. Certain Hermetic schools argue that the transmutation of lead into gold is analogical for the transmutation of the physical body (Saturn or lead) into (Gold) with the goal of attaining immortality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golden-dawn.com/eu/displaycontent.aspx?pageid=102 The True Nature of Hermetic Alchemy].&lt;/ref&gt; This is described as Internal Alchemy. Starting with the [[Middle Ages]], [[Persian scientists|Persian]] and European alchemists invested much effort in the search for the &quot;[[philosopher's stone]]&quot;, a legendary substance that was believed to be an essential ingredient for either or both of those goals. Pope John XXII issued a [[Papal bull|bull]] against alchemical counterfeiting, and the [[Cistercians]] banned the practice amongst their members. In the late 14th century, [[Piers the Ploughman]] and [[Chaucer]] both painted unflattering pictures of Alchemists as thieves and liars; and in 1403, Henry IV of England banned the practice of Alchemy without first receiving a licence to practise it from the King. However, by the 16th C, Elizabeth I employed the polymath [[John Dee]], regarded by many as an alchemist, as her astrologer and occasional advisor. By contrast, [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the late 16th century, sponsored various alchemists in their work at his court in Prague, one of which was a particular alchemist named [[Edward Kelley]]. Kelley had been a protegee of John Dee in England.

It is a popular belief that Alchemists made contributions to the &quot;chemical&quot; industries of the day—ore testing and refining, metalworking, production of gunpowder, ink, dyes, paints, cosmetics, [[Tanning|leather tanning]], ceramics, glass manufacture, preparation of extracts, liquors, and so on (it seems that the preparation of ''[[aqua vitae]]'', the &quot;water of life&quot;, was a fairly popular &quot;experiment&quot; among European alchemists). Alchemists contributed [[distillation]] to Western Europe.
The double origin of Alchemy in Greek philosophy as well as in Egyptian and Mesopotamian technology set, from the start, a double approach: the technological, operative one, which [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] call [[extravert]], and the mystic, contemplative, psychological one, which von Franz names as [[introvert]]. These are not mutually exclusive, but complementary instead, as meditation requires practice in the real world, and conversely.&lt;ref name=&quot;FRAALC97&quot;&gt;von Franz, M-L. Alchemical Active Imagination. Shambala. Boston. 1997. ISBN 0-87773-589-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several early alchemists, such as [[Zosimos of Panopolis]], are recorded as viewing alchemy as a spiritual discipline, and, in the Middle Ages, metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and molecular material processes as mere metaphors for spiritual entities, spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformations. In this sense, the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas' were a blind, hiding their true [[spiritual philosophy]], which being at odds with the Medieval Christian Church was a necessity that could have otherwise led them to the &quot;stake and rack&quot; of the Inquisition under charges of heresy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Blavatsky |first= H.P. |title= [[The Secret Doctrine]] |publisher= Theosophical Publishing Company |year= 1888 |isbn= 978-1557000026 |volume=ii |page=238 |url=http://www.phx-ult-lodge.org/SDVolume2.htm |nopp= true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state towards a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state; and the philosopher's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously &quot;decoded&quot; in order to discover their true meaning.

In his ''Alchemical Catechism'', [[Paracelsus]] clearly denotes that his usage of the metals was a symbol:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver?
A. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the Philosophers are full of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/alc/tschoudy.htm |title=Alchemical Catechism |accessdate=2007-04-18 |author=Paracelsus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Psychology ===

Alchemical symbolism has been occasionally used by [[psychology|psychologists]] and philosophers. [[Carl Jung]] reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and began to show the inner meaning of alchemical work as a [[spirituality|spiritual]] path.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung, C. G. 1944&quot;&gt;Jung, C. G. (1944). Psychology and Alchemy (2nd ed. 1968 Collected Works Vol. 12 ISBN 0-691-01831-6). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G., &amp; Hinkle, B. M. (1912). Psychology of the Unconscious : a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido, a contribution to the history of the evolution of thought. London: Kegan Paul Trench Trubner. (revised in 1952 as Symbols of Transformation, Collected Works Vol.5 ISBN 0-691-01815-4).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung saw alchemy as a Western proto-psychology dedicated to the achievement of [[individuation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jung, C. G. 1944&quot;/&gt; In his interpretation, alchemy was the vessel by which [[Gnosticism]] survived its various purges into the [[Renaissance]],&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G., &amp; Jaffe A. (1962). Memories, Dreams, Reflections. London: Collins. This is Jung's autobiography, recorded and edited by Aniela Jaffe, ISBN 0-679-72395-1.&lt;/ref&gt; a concept also followed by others such as [[Stephan A. Hoeller]]. In this sense, Jung viewed alchemy as comparable to a [[Yoga]] of the East, and more adequate to the Western mind than Eastern religions and philosophies. The practice of Alchemy seemed to change the mind and spirit of the Alchemist. Conversely, spontaneous changes on the mind of Western people undergoing any important stage in [[individuation]] seems to produce, on occasion, imagery known to Alchemy and relevant to the person's situation.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G. - Psychology and Alchemy; Symbols of Transformation.&lt;/ref&gt;

His interpretation of [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemical texts]] in terms of his [[analytical psychology]] also served the function of comparing Eastern and Western alchemical imagery and core concepts and hence its possible inner sources ([[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]).&lt;ref&gt;C.-G. Jung Preface to [[Richard Wilhelm]]'s translation of the [[I Ching]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.-G. Jung Preface to the translation of [[Secret of the Golden Flower|The Secret of The Golden Flower]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marie-Louise von Franz]], a disciple of Jung, continued Jung's studies on Alchemy and its psychological meaning.

== Alchemy as a subject of historical research ==

The history of alchemy has become a vigorous academic field. As the obscure hermetic language of the alchemists is gradually being &quot;deciphered&quot;, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, [[kabbala|kabbalism]], [[spiritualism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and other mystic movements, [[cryptography]], [[witchcraft]], and the evolution of [[science]] and [[philosophy]].

===History===
{{Main|History of alchemy}}

Alchemy covers several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents. These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and &quot;genetic&quot; relationships. One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: [[Chinese alchemy]], centered in [[China]] and its zone of cultural influence; [[Rasayana|Indian alchemy]], centred around the [[Indian subcontinent]]; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and whose center has shifted over the millennia from [[ancient Egypt]], to the [[Greco-Roman world]], to the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], and finally [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]]. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoism]] and Indian alchemy with the [[Indian religions|Dharmic faiths]], whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of, but influenced by, various [[Western religion]]s. It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.

== Modern connections to alchemy ==

In the Islamic world, [[Alchemy (Islam)|alchemy]] was a forerunner of modern scientific [[chemistry]], with alchemists such as [[Rhazes]], [[Avicenna]], [[Ahmad ibn Imad al-din|Imad ul-din]] and [[Jābir ibn Hayyān|Hayyān]].

Up to the 17th century, alchemy was practiced by scientists, such as [[Isaac Newton]] &amp;ndash; who devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]) than he did to either optics or physics. Other alchemists of the [[Western world]] who were eminent in their other studies include [[Roger Bacon]], and [[Tycho Brahe]].

During the 17th century, practical alchemy started to evolve into modern chemistry,&lt;ref&gt;William R Newman &amp; Lawrence M Principe (1998) &quot;The Etymological Origins of an Historiographic Mistake&quot; in ''Early Science and Medicine'', Vol. 3, No. 1 pp.32-65&lt;/ref&gt; as it was renamed by [[Robert Boyle]], the &quot;father of modern chemistry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Deem, Rich |title=The Religious Affiliation of Robert Boyle the father of modern chemistry. From: Famous Scientists Who Believed in God |year=2005 |publisher=adherents.com |url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pb/Robert_Boyle.html |accessdate=2009-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''The Skeptical Chymist'', Boyle attacked [[Paracelsus]] and the venerable [[natural philosophy]] of [[Aristotle]], which was taught at universities. However, Boyle's biographers, in their emphasis that he laid the foundations of modern chemistry, neglect how steadily he clung to the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic sciences]] and to Alchemy, in theory, practice and doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2707281 | last = More | first = Louis Trenchard | title = Boyle as Alchemist | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–76 | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | date = January 1941 | accessdate = 30 March 2010 | jstor = 2707281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of alchemy continued in the 18th century with the birth of modern chemistry, which provided a more precise and reliable framework for matter transmutations and medicine, within a new grand design of the universe based on rational [[materialism]].

=== Alchemy in traditional medicine ===
Traditional medicines involve transmutation by alchemy, using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques. In [[Chinese medicine]] the alchemical traditions of [[pao zhi]] will transform the nature of the temperature, taste, body part accessed or toxicity. In [[Ayurveda]] the [[Samskara (Ayurvedic)|samskaras]] are used to transform [[heavy metals]] and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity. These processes are actively used to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Junius, Manfred M; ''The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy: An Herbalist's Guide to Preparing Medicinal Essences, Tinctures, and Elixirs''; Healing Arts Press 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear transmutation===
{{Main|Nuclear transmutation|Synthesis of noble metals}}
In 1919, [[Ernest Rutherford]] used [[artificial disintegration]] to convert [[nitrogen]] into [[oxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stmary.ws/physics/amsco_review_and_glencoe/chapter05.pdf|format=pdf |title= Reviewing Physics: The Physical Setting |publisher= Amsco School Publications |quote= The first artificial transmutation of one or more elements to another was performed by Rutherford in 1919. Rutherford bombarded nitrogen with energetic alpha particles that were moving fast enough to overcome the electric repulsion between themselves and the target nuclei. The alpha particles collided with, and were absorbed by, the nitrogen nuclei, and protons were ejected. In the process oxygen and hydrogen nuclei were created.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, this sort of ''scientific transmutation'' has been routinely performed in many [[nuclear physics]]-related laboratories and facilities, like [[particle accelerator]]s, [[nuclear power station]]s and [[nuclear weapons]] as a by-product of [[fission]] and other physical processes. A patent for a process to create gold and platinum from other elements using [[cold fusion]] has been filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stmary.ws/physics |title=Man made gold and platinum}} A man made method, utilizing particles bombardment technique, is used to produce Gold and Platinum. The particles bombardment technique uses particle accelerator to accelerate Lithium particles to high speed. These high speed Lithium particles contain high energy. These high energy Lithium particles are used to bombard Osmium element. Then elements Lithium and Osmium undergo cold fusion process that they are combined to produce element Gold. By the same method, Helium particles are accelerated by particle accelerator to high speed. These high speed Helium particles contain high energy. These high energy Helium particles are used to bombard Osmium element. Then elements Helium and Osmium undergo cold fusion process that they are combined to produce element Platinum.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In literature ===
Sir [[Thomas Malory]] uses Alchemy as a motif that underlies the personal, psychological, and aesthetic development of Sir Gareth of Orkney in [[Le Morte d'Arthur]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Sir Gareth's quest parallels the process of Alchemy in that he first undergoes the ''nigredo'' phase by defeating the black knight and wearing his armor. After this, Gareth defeats knights representing the four elements, thereby subsuming their power. In fighting and defeating the Red Knight (the overall purpose of his quest), he undergoes and passes the ''rubedo'' phase. Gareth, toward the end of his quest, accepts a ring from his paramour, Lyoness, which transforms his armor into multicolors. This alludes to the panchromatic philosopher's stone, and while he is in multicolored armor, he is unbeatable.

The award-winning novel by [[Paulo Coelho]], [[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]], is largely about a boy named Santiago and his travels with an Alchemist.

A play by [[Ben Jonson]], [[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]], is a satirical and skeptical take on the subject.

Part 2 of [[Goethe]]'s [[Faust]], is full of alchemical symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;see Alice Raphael: Goethe and the Philosopher's Stone, symbolical patterns in 'The Parable' and the second part of 'Faust', London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Hermetic Fictions: Alchemy and Irony in the Novel'' ([[Keele University]] Press, 1995), by David Meakin, alchemy is also featured in such novels and poems as those by [[William Godwin]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Emile Zola]], [[Jules Verne]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[James Joyce]], [[Gustav Meyrink]], [[Lindsay Clarke]], [[Marguerite Yourcenar]], [[Umberto Eco]], [[Michel Butor]], [[Paulo Coelho]], [[Amanda Quick]], [[Gabriel García Marquez]] and [[Maria Szepes]].

[[Hilary Mantel]], in her novel ''[[Fludd (novel)|Fludd]]'' (1989, Penguin), mentions the spagyric art. 'After separation, drying out, moistening, dissolving, coagulating, fermenting, comes purification, recombination: the creation of substances the world until now has never beheld. This is the opus contra naturam, this is the spagyric art, this is the Alchymical Wedding'. (page 79)

In Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', it is placed within the Tenth ring of the 8th circle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/dante/in29.htm Dante's Divine Comedy, Inferno, Canto 29], hosted on the [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', real-life alchemist [[Nicolas Flamel]] is supposed to have successfully created the [[Philosopher's stone]], which could turn metal into gold and create an elixir of immortality that enabled him to live into the 1990s, when the book is set. 

The manga and anime series ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'' bases itself on a more fantasised version of alchemy, based on the principle of equivalent exchange. In the manga and anime series ''[[Buso Renkin]]'', alchemy is used to form Kakugane, which transforms into a weapon based on a human's fighting instincts. Also, alchemy is used to create [[homunculi]].

The main character in the play ''[[Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet)]]'', by Ann-Marie MacDonald, attempts (and succeeds) at determining the alchemy behind Shakespeare's work, ''[[Othello]]''.

Alchemy plays a central role in the [[Baroque Cycle]] novels of [[Neil Stephenson]].

=== In contemporary art ===
In the twentieth century alchemy was a profoundly important source of inspiration for the Surrealist artist [[Max Ernst]], who used the symbolism of alchemy to inform and guide his work. M.E. Warlick wrote his ''Max Ernst and Alchemy'' describing this relationship in detail.

Contemporary artists use alchemy as inspiring subject matter, like [[Odd Nerdrum]], whose interest has been noted by [[Richard Vine]], and the painter [[Michael Pearce]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.callutheran.edu/schools/cas/programs/art/faculty/?profile_id=207 Cal Lutheran | Department of Art - Faculty&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; whose interest in alchemy dominates his work.

More recently, the German experimental filmmaker [[Jürgen Reble]] has referenced alchemical processes in his physical and chemical manipulation of the filmstrip, describing one particular work, &lt;i&gt;Alchemy&lt;/i&gt;, as bridging the gap between the &quot;processing and fixing&quot; of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Reble, Jurgen. &quot;Chemistry and the Alchemy of Colour&quot;. Millennium Film Journal, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the moving image artist [[Richard Ashrowan]] created a video installation, &lt;i&gt;Alchemist&lt;/i&gt;, which used texts by the twelfth century alchemist [[Michael Scot]] and included performances related to alchemical themes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashrowan.com/works/alchemist/ ''Alchemist'' Artist's web page and documentation, accessed 03/03/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Galileo]] is often referred to as the Father of Modern Astronomy.]]
An '''astronomer''' is a [[scientist]] who studies [[Celestial body|celestial bodies]] such as [[planet]]s, [[star]]s and [[Galaxy|galaxies]].

Historically, [[astronomy]] was more concerned with the classification and description of [[phenomena]] in the sky, while [[astroplanes]] attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws. Today, that distinction has mostly disappeared. Professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a [[PhD]] in [[physics]] or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or [[University|universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noao.edu/education/astfaq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Becoming an Astronomer |accessdate=29 March 2009 |work= |publisher=NOAO}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spend the majority of their time working on research, although they quite often have other duties such as teaching, building instruments, or aiding in the operation of an observatory. The number of professional astronomers in the United States is actually quite small. The [[American Astronomical Society]], which is the major organization of professional astronomers in North America, has approximately 7,700 members. This number includes scientists from other fields such as physics, [[geology]], and [[engineering]], whose research interests are closely related to astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aas.org/ |title=American Astronomical Society Home |accessdate=14 August 2009 |work= |publisher=AAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] comprises almost 10,145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the PhD level and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/about/ |title=About IAU |accessdate=14 August 2009 |work= |publisher=IAU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of professional astronomers worldwide is not much larger than the population of a small [[town]], there is a huge community of [[amateur]] astronomers. Most cities have [[amateur astronomy]] clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties in their communities. The [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] is the largest general astronomical society in the world, comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astrosociety.org/about.html |title=About Us |accessdate=29 March 2009 |work= |publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any [[hobby]], most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to [[stargazing]] and reading the latest developments in research. However, amateurs span the range from so-called &quot;armchair astronomers&quot; to the very ambitious, who own science-grade [[telescope]]s and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research.

==Calculation in astronomy==
[[Image:Corpus Christ College MS 283 (1).png|thumb|Corpus Christi College MS 283]]

[[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwārizmī]]'s {{unicode|''Zīj al-Sindhind''}}&lt;ref name=&quot;toomer&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Toomer|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Arabic: زيج &quot;astronomical tables of [[Sindh|Sind]] and [[Indian subcontinent|Hind]]&quot;) is a work consisting of approximately 37 chapters on calendrical and astronomical calculations and 116 tables with calendrical, astronomical and astrological data, as well as a table of [[sine]] values. This is the first of many Arabic ''[[Zij]]es'' based on the [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomical]] methods known as the ''sindhind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1956|pp= 26–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work contains tables for the movements of the [[sun]], the [[moon]] and the five [[planet]]s known at the time. This work marked the turning point in [[Islamic astronomy]]. Hitherto, Muslim astronomers had adopted a primarily research approach to the field, translating works of others and learning already discovered knowledge. Al-Khwarizmi's work marked the beginning of non-traditional methods of study and calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dallal|1999|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Arabic version (written c. 820) is lost, but a version by the Spanish astronomer [[Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti]] (c. 1000) has survived in a Latin translation, presumably by [[Adelard of Bath]] (January 26, 1126).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1956|p= 128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four surviving manuscripts of the Latin translation are kept at the Bibliothèque publique (Chartres), the Bibliothèque Mazarine (Paris), the Bibliotheca Nacional (Madrid) and the Bodleian Library in (Oxford).

==Modern astronomers==
Contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night, it is very rare for a modern professional astronomer to use an eyepiece on a larger [[telescope]]. It is far more common to use a [[charge-coupled device]] camera to record a long, deep exposure, allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the [[light]] is added over time. Before CCDs, photographic plates were a common method of observation. Modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes - most spend a few weeks per year observing, and the rest of their time reducing the data (changing it from raw data to processed images) and analyzing it. Many astronomers work entirely from [[Astronomical surveys|astronomical survey]] or [[space observatory]] data. Others work with [[radio telescopes]] like the [[Very Large Array]], which is entirely automated, although it is maintained by telescope operators.

Astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes. Most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes [[planetarium]]s as a public service and to encourage interest in the field.
